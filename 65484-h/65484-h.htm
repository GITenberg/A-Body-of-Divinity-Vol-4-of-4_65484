</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> CXXXVII. <i>Which is the seventh Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The seventh Commandment is, [<i>Thou shalt not commit
adultery.</i>]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> CXXXVIII. <i>What are the duties required in the seventh
Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The duties required in the seventh Commandment, are,
chastity in body, mind, affections, words, and behaviour;
and the preservation of it in ourselves and others; watchfulness
over the eyes, and all the senses; temperance, keeping
of chaste company, modesty in apparel, marriage by
those that have not the gift of continency; conjugal love,
and cohabitation, diligent labour in our callings, shunning all
occasions of uncleanness, resisting temptations thereunto.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest.</span> CXXXIX. <i>What are the sins forbidden in the seventh
Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sins forbidden in the seventh Commandment, besides
the neglect of the duties required, are, adultery, fornication,
rape, incest, sodomy, and all unnatural lusts, all
unclean imaginations, thoughts, purposes, and affections, all
corrupt or filthy communications, or listening thereunto;
wanton looks, impudent, or light behaviour; immodest apparel;
prohibiting of lawful, and dispensing with unlawful
marriages, allowing, tolerating, keeping of stews, and resorting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>to them; intangling vows of single life; undue delay of
marriage, having more wives or husbands than one, at the
same time; unjust divorce, or desertion; idleness, gluttony,
drunkenness, unchaste company, lascivious songs, books,
pictures, dancings, stage plays, and all other provocations
to, or acts of uncleanness, either in ourselves or others.</p>

<p class='c011'>This Commandment respects, more especially, the government
of the affections, and the keeping our minds and
bodies in such an holy frame, that nothing impure, immodest,
or contrary to the strictest chastity, may defile, or be a reproach
to us, or insinuate itself into our conversation with one
another. And, in order thereunto, we are to set a strict watch
over our thoughts and actions, and avoid every thing that may
be an occasion of this sin, and use those proper methods that
may prevent all temptations to it. Therefore we ought to
associate ourselves with none but those whose conversation is
chaste, and such as becomes Christians, to abhor all words
and actions that are not so much as to be named among persons
professing godliness. As for those who cannot, without
inconveniency, govern their affections, but are sometimes
tempted to any thing that is inconsistent with that purity of
heart and life, which all ought religiously to maintain, it is
their duty to enter into a married state; which is an ordinance
that God has appointed, to prevent the breach of this
Commandment. And this leads us to consider the sins forbidden
therein, together with the occasions thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Concerning the sins forbidden in this Commandment.
And,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Some are not only contrary to nature, but inconsistent
with the least pretences to religion; which were abhorred by
the very Heathen themselves, and, by the law of God, punished
with death; which punishment, when it has not been inflicted,
God has, by his immediate hand, testified his vengeance
against sinners, by raining down fire and brimstone from
heaven, as he did upon the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrha,
Lev. xviii. 22,—25. chap. xx. 13, 15, 16. Rom. i. 24,
26, 27, 28. Gen. xix. 24. These sins are called in this answer,
incest, sodomy, and unnatural lusts. To which we may
add, offering violence to others, and thereby forcing them to
do what they could not even think of, but with abhorrence;
this is called rape; and, by the law of God, the guilty person
was punished with death, Deut. xxii. 25.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. There are other sins, whereby this Commandment is violated;
which, though more common, are, nevertheless, such as
are attended with a very great degree of guilt and impurity.
These are either, such as are committed by those who are unmarried,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span><i>viz.</i> fornication, or by those who are married, as
adultery; the latter of which, by the law of God, was punished
with death, Lev. xx. 10. as contained in it several aggravating
circumstances; inasmuch as hereby the marriage contract
is violated; that mutual affection, which is the end of that
relation broken; and thereby the greatest injury is done to the
innocent as well as ruin brought on the guilty. However,
both these sins agree in this, that they proceed from a corrupt
heart; as our Saviour says, Mat. xv. 19. and argue the person
that is guilty of them, alienated from the life of God.
And to this we may add,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. That, another sin forbidden in this Commandment is,
polygamy, or a having more husbands, or wives, than one, at
the same time; together with that which often accompanies it,
<i>viz.</i> concubinage. It is beyond dispute, that many good men
have been guilty of this sin, as appears by what is recorded,
in scripture, concerning Abraham, Jacob, David, <i>&amp;c.</i> and we
do not find that they are expressly reproved for it, which has
given occasion to some modern writers, to think that it was
not unlawful in those ages, but was afterwards rendered so by
being prohibited under the gospel-dispensation<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. This, indeed,
cuts the knot of a very considerable difficulty; but it
contains another that is equally great; inasmuch as hereby it
does not appear to be contrary to the law of nature; and therefore
I would rather chuse to take another method to solve it,
viz. that many bad actions of good men are recorded in scripture,
but not approved of, nor proposed for our imitation. Of
this kind I must conclude the polygamy and concubinage of
several holy men, mentioned in scripture, to have been. And
that it may appear that this practice was not justifiable, let it
be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That, some sin or other is often expressly mentioned,
as the occasion hereof. Thus Abraham’s taking Hagar, was
occasioned by Sarah’s unbelief; because the promise of her
having a son was not immediately fulfilled, Gen. xvi. 1, 2.
And Jacob’s taking Rachel to wife after Leah, and his own
discontent arising from it, was occasioned by Laban’s unjust
dealing with him, and his going in unto Bilhah, was occasioned
by Rachel’s unreasonable desire of children; and his taking
Zilpah, by Leah’s ambitious desire of having pre-eminence
over Rachel, by the number of her children, chap. xxix, and
xxx.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) This was generally attended with the breach of that
peace, which is so desirable a blessing in families, and many
disorders that ensued hereupon. Accordingly, we read of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>irreconcilable quarrel that there was between Sarah and Hagar;
and Ishmael’s hatred of Isaac, which the apostle calls <i>persecution</i>,
Gal. iv. 39. And to this we may add, the contentions
that were in Jacob’s family, and the envy expressed by the
children of one of his wives, against those of another; and the
opposition which one wife often expressed to another as that
of Peninnah, one of the wives of Elkanah, to Hannah, the
other. Therefore we must conclude, that Isaac’s example is
rather to be followed in this matter, who had but one wife,
and he loved her better than many of the patriarch’s did theirs;
whose love was divided among several.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> 1. If polygamy was a sin against the light of nature,
it is strange, that it should be committed by good men; and,
that they should live and die without repenting of it, nor be,
in the least, reproved for it; as we do not find that they were,
in scripture.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> It was indeed, a sin, which they might have known
to be so, had they duly considered it, in all its circumstances
and consequences; but this they did not; and therefore it was
not so great a sin in them, as it would be in us, who have
clearer discoveries of the heinous nature of it. Therefore, if
we suppose they repented of all sin agreeably to the light they
had, they might be saved; and this, though unrepented of,
was no bar to their salvation, supposing they knew it not to
be a sin; and God’s not having explicitly reproved them for
it, argues only his forbearance, but not his approbation of it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> 2. It is farther objected, that God says, by Nathan,
to David, <i>I gave thee thy master’s wives into thy bosom</i>, 2
Sam. xii. 8. therefore, that which God gives, it is not unlawful
for man to receive.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> The meaning of that scripture in general, is, that
God made him king; and then, according to the custom of
the eastern kings, he took possession of what belonged to his
predecessor, and consequently of his wives. Therefore God
might be said to give David Saul’s wives providentially, in
giving him the kingdom; so that they were his property, that
he might take them for his own, according to custom, if he
was inclined so to do. And this the kings of Judah generally
did; though it does not follow from hence that God approved
of it; in like manner as tyrants may be said to be raised up
by God’s providence and permission; nevertheless, he does
not approve of their tyranny.</p>

<p class='c006'>All that we shall add, under this head, to what has been
suggested, concerning the disorders that polygamy has occasioned
in families, is, that it is contrary to the first institution
of marriage. God created but one woman as an help-meet
for Adam; though, if ever there were any pretence for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>necessity of one man’s having more wives, it must have been
in that instance, in which it seemed necessary for the increase
of the world; but he rather chose that mankind should be
propagated by slower advances, than to give the least dispensation,
or indulgence to polygamy, as being contrary to the
law of nature, Gen. ii. 22,-24. And the prophet, in Mal.
ii. 15. takes notice of God’s <i>making but one</i>; though he had
<i>the residue of the Spirit</i>; and therefore could have given Adam
more wives than one. And the reason assigned for this was,
that <i>he might seek a godly seed</i>, i. e. that the children that
should be born of many wives, might not be the result of the
ungodly practice of their father, as it would be, were this contrary
to the law of nature; which we suppose it to be. This
I rather understand by <i>a godly seed</i>, and not that the character
of <i>godly</i> refers to the children; for these could not be said
to be godly, or ungodly, as the consequence of their parents
having one or more wives.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is one scripture more that I cannot wholly pass over,
which, to me, seems a plain prohibition of polygamy, in Levit.
xviii. 18. <i>Thou shalt not take a wife to her sister, to vex her,
to uncover her nakedness, besides the other in her life-time.</i>
This respects either incest or polygamy; one of which must be
meant by <i>taking a wife to her sister</i>. Now it cannot be a
prohibition of incest; because it is said, <i>Thou shalt not</i> do it
<i>in her life-time</i>; which plainly intimates, that it might be done
after her death. Whereas it is certainly contrary to the law
of God and nature, for a person to take his wife’s sister after
her decease, as well as in her life-time. Therefore the meaning
is, Thou shalt not take another wife to her whom thou
hast married; by which means they will become sisters. And
here is another reason assigned hereof, <i>viz.</i> the envy, jealousy,
and vexation that would attend such a practice, as the taking
another wife would be a means of vexing, or making her uneasy.
And therefore the sense is, as is observed in the marginal
reading; <i>Thou shalt not take one wife to another</i>; or,
Thou shalt not have more wives than one. This is a plain
prohibition of this sin; but whether some holy men, in following
ages, understood the meaning of this law, may be questioned;
and therefore they were not sensible of the guilt they
hereby contracted. Thus we have considered some of the
sins forbidden in this Commandment. Every particular instance
of the breach hereof, would exceed our intended brevity,
on the subject we are treating of. Therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall proceed to consider the aggravations, more especially,
of the sins of fornication and adultery; which may also
with just reason, be applied to all other unnatural lusts; which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>have been before considered as a breach of this Commandment.
And,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] They are opposite to sanctification, even as darkness is
to light, hell to heaven; thus the apostle opposes fornication
and uncleanness, to it, 1 Thes. iv. 3, 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] These sins are inconsistent with that relation, we pretend
to stand in, to Christ, as members of his body; inasmuch
as we join ourselves in a confederacy with his profligate enemies,
1 Cor. vi. 15, 16. And to this we may add, that they
are a dishonour to, and a defilement of our own bodies, which
ought to be the temples of the Holy Ghost, and therefore should
be consecrated to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] They bring guilt and ruin on two persons at once, as
well as a blot and stain on each of their families, and a wound
to religion by those who make any profession of it, as it <i>gives
occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme</i>, Prov. vi. 33.
2 Sam. xii. 14.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] They bring with them many other sins; as they tend
to vitiate the affections, deprave the mind, defile the conscience,
and provoke God to give persons up to spiritual judgments,
which will end in their running into all excess of riot.</p>

<p class='c006'>And to this we may add, that many sad consequences
will ensue on the commission of these sins; as they tend to
blast and ruin their substance in the world, Job xxxi. 9, 11,
12. debase and stupify the soul, and deprive it of wisdom,
Hos. iv. 11. Prov. vi. 32. chap. vii. 22. wound the conscience,
and expose the person who is guilty hereof, to the utmost hazard
of perishing for ever, chap. vi. 33. chap. vii. 13, 19, 26,
27. And if God is pleased to give him repentance, it will be
attended with great bitterness, Eccl. vii. 26.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We are now to consider the occasion of these sins to be
avoided by those who would not break this Commandment,
and these are,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Intemperance, or excess in eating or drinking; the former
of which is a making provision for the flesh, to fulfil the
lusts thereof; the latter confounds and buries the little reason
a person was master of, and makes him an easy prey to temptation.
This was Lot’s case, who kept his integrity in Sodom;
yet being made drunk by his daughters in Zoar, he committed
the abominable sin of incest with them, Gen. xix. 31.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Idleness, consisting either in the neglect of business, or
indulging too much sleep, which occasions many temptations.
Thus David first gave way to sloth, and then was tempted to
uncleanness; and it is observed, that <i>at the time when kings go
forth to battle</i>, 2 Sam. xi. 1, 2. and he ought to have been
with his army in the field, he tarried at Jerusalem, and slept in
the middle of the day; for <i>in the evening tide he arose from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>off his bed</i>; And the heinous sin he was guilty of, which was
the greatest blemish in his life, ensued hereupon.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Pride in apparel, or other ornaments, beyond the bounds
of modesty, or for other ends than what God, when he clothed
man at first, intended; when our attire is inconsistent with our
circumstances in the world, or the character of persons professing
godliness: This God reproves the Jews for, when
grown very degenerate, and near to ruin, Isa. iii. 16, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>seq.</i>
And Jezebel, when Jehu came in quest of her, <i>painted her
face, and tired her head</i>; but this did not prevent his executing
God’s righteous judgments upon her. All these things
are mentioned as the sins for which Sodom was infamous;
and gave occasion to those other abominations, which
provoked God to destroy them, Ezek. xvi. 49. And to this
we may add,</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Keeping evil company: Thus it is said of the lewd woman,
<i>she hath cast down many wounded</i>, Prov. vii. 26. This
will hasten our own ruin; especially if we associate ourselves
with such persons out of choice: for it is a sign that our
hearts are exceedingly depraved and alienated from God: Nevertheless,
if Providence cast our lot amongst bad company,
we may escape that guilt and defilement, which would otherwise
ensue, if we bear our testimony against their sin, and are
<i>grieved</i> for it, as Lot was for the filthy conversation of the Sodomites,
among whom he dwelt, 2 Pet. ii. 7, 8. Moreover, the
frequenting those places where there are mixed dancing, masquerades,
stage-plays, <i>&amp;c.</i> which tend to corrupt the principles
and practices, and seldom fail of defiling the consciences, and
manners of those who attend on them: These are nurseries of
vice, and give occasion to this sin, and many others, Prov. vi.
27, compared with 32.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the remedies against it, these are, an exercising a
constant watchfulness against all temptations thereunto, chap.
viii. 9. avoiding all conversation with men or books which tend
to corrupt the mind, and fill it with levity, under a pretence of
improving it: But more especially a retaining a constant sense
of God’s all-seeing eye, his infinite purity and vindictive justice,
which will induce us to say as Joseph did, in the like case,
<i>How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God</i>, Gen.
xxxix. 9.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CXL., CXLI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXL.</span> <i>Which is the eighth Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The eighth Commandment is, [<i>Thou shalt not steal.</i>]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXLI.</span> <i>What are the duties required in the eighth
Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The duties required in the eighth Commandment are,
truth, faithfulness, and justice in contracts, and commerce
between man and man; rendering to every one his due;
restitution of goods unlawfully detained from the right
owners thereof; giving, and lending freely, according to our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>abilities, and the necessities of others; moderation of our
judgments, wills, and affections, concerning worldly goods;
a provident care and study to get, keep, use, and dispose
those things which are necessary and convenient for the sustentation
of our nature, and suitable to our condition; a
lawful calling, and diligence in it; frugality, avoiding unnecessary
law-suits, and suretyship, or other like engagements;
and an endeavour, by all just and lawful means, to
procure, preserve, and further the wealth and outward estate
of others, as well as our own.</p>

<p class='c011'>This Commandment supposes, that God has given to every
one a certain portion of the good things of this world,
that he may lay claim to as his own; which no other has a
right to. The general scope and design thereof, is to put us
upon using endeavours to promote our own and our neighbour’s
wealth and outward estate. As to what concerns ourselves,
it respects the government of our affections, and setting
due bounds to our desires of worldly things, that they may not
exceed what the good providence of God has allotted for us, in
order to our comfortable passage through this world. Thus
Agar prays, <i>Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with
food convenient for me</i>, Prov. xxx. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what respects our endeavours to gain the world; it
requires a due care and diligence, to get, and keep a competency
thereof; that we may not, through our own default, expose
ourselves to those straits and necessities which are the consequence
of sloth and negligence, chap. xxiii. 21. chap. xxiv. 30,
31. God may, indeed, give estates to some without any pains,
or care to get them, Deut. vi. 10, 11. yet, even in this case,
sloth is a sin which brings with it many hurtful lusts, that render
riches a snare, and hindrance to their spiritual welfare:
Therefore they, who are in prosperous circumstances in the
world, ought not to lay aside all care and industry to improve,
what they have to the glory of God. But, on the other hand,
they who are in a low condition, ought to use a provident care
and diligence, in order to their having a comfortable subsistence
therein. Accordingly this Commandment obliges us to
use all lawful endeavours to promote our own and our neighbour’s
wealth, and outward estate.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. To promote our own wealth and estate. This we are
to do,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. By frugality in our expences, avoiding profuseness; and
that, either in giving away our substance to unfit objects, to
wit, those who are in better circumstances than ourselves, who
ought to be givers rather than receivers, Prov. xxii. 16. or
else in making large contributions to support a bad cause, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>in consuming our substance on our lusts. Likewise when we
are unwarily profuse in those expences, which would be otherwise
lawful, did they not exceed our circumstances or income
in the world, which contains a disregard of the future estate of
our families, and taking a method to reduce ourselves and
them to poverty, 1 Tim. v. 8. Or, if our circumstances will
admit of large expenses; yet, to abound therein, merely out
of ostentation, and at the same time, to withhold our liberality
from the poor is inconsistent with frugality.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We ought also to be diligent, and industrious in our
calling; and, in order thereunto,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) We are wisely to make choice of such a calling, in
which we may glorify God, and expect his blessing, in order
to the promoting our wealth and outward estate; therefore
that business is to be chosen which we are most capable of managing,
and has in itself the fewest temptations attending it;
especially such wherein the conscience is not burdened by unlawful
oaths, or prostituting solemn ordinances, not designed
by Christ as a qualification for them. Moreover, we are not to
choose those callings wherein the gain is obtained by oppression
or extortion, and which cannot be managed without danger
of sinning; which will bring the blast of providence on all
our undertakings. Therefore we are earnestly to desire God’s
direction in this weighty concern, as well as depend on him
for success therein, Eccl. ix. 11. Deut. viii. 18.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) When we have made choice of a lawful calling, we are
to manage it in such a way, that we may expect the blessing
of God, in order to the promoting our wealth and outward
estate. Accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] Let us pursue and manage it with right and warrantable
ends, to wit, the glory of God; and, in subordination
thereunto, our providing for ourselves and families, that we
may be in a capacity of doing good to others, and serving the
interest of Christ in our day and generation.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Let us take heed that our secular employments do not
rob God of that time, which ought to be devoted to his worship;
and that our hearts be not alienated from him, so that while
we are labouring for the world, we should live without God
therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] Let us take heed that we do not launch out too far, or
run too great hazards in trade, resolving that we will be suddenly
rich or poor, which may tend to the ruin of our own families,
as well as others, 1 Tim. vi. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] Let us bear disappointments in our callings, with patience
and submission to the will of God, without murmuring
or repining at his wise and sovereign dispensations of providence
herein.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>II. This Commandment obliges us to promote the wealth
and outward estate of our neighbour. This we are to do, by
exercising strict justice in our contracts and dealings with all
men; and by relieving the wants and necessities of those who
stand in need of our charity.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As to what respects the exercise of justice in our dealings.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) We must take heed, that we do not exact upon, or take
unreasonable profit of those whom we deal with, arising from
the ignorance of some, and the necessities of others, Jer. iii. 15.
Neither, must we use any methods to supplant and ruin others,
against the laws of trade, by selling goods at a cheaper rate
than any one can afford them, thereby doing damage to ourselves
with a design to ruin them, who are less able to bear such
a loss.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Those goods, which we know to be faulty, are not, by
false arts, or deceitful words, to be sold, as though they were
not so, Amos viii. 6. And, on the other hand, the buyer is not
to take advantage of the ignorance of the seller, as it sometimes
happens; neither is he to pretend that it is worth less than he
really thinks it to be, Prov. xx. 14.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Nothing is to be diminished in weight or measure,
from what was bought, worse goods to be delivered than what
were purchased, Amos vii. 5. nor the <i>balances to be falsified
by deceit</i>, Deut. xxv. 13, 14, 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are to promote the good of our poor distressed neighbour,
in works of charity; and that not only by inward sympathy,
or bowels of compassion towards him; but according to
our ability, by relieving him. To induce us hereunto, let us
consider, that outward good things are talents given us, with
this view, that hereby we may be in a capacity of helping
others, as well as be needing help ourselves. And when we
do this, we may be said to improve what we have received
from God, as those who are accountable to him for it, and testify
our gratitude to him for outward blessings. It may also be
considered, that Christ takes such acts of kindness, when proceeding
from an unfeigned love to him, as done to himself,
Matt. xxv. 40. Prov. xix. 17. And, to this we may add, that
there are many special motives, taken from the objects of our
charity, namely, the pressing necessities of some, the excelling
holiness of others; and, in some instances, we may consider,
that, by an act of charity, whereby we relieve one, we do good
to many; or the tendency that this may have to promote the
interest of Christ in general, when we relieve those that suffer
for the sake of the gospel. This leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Of whom works of charity are required. If this be duly
weighed, we shall find, that scarce any are exempted from
this duty, except it be those of whom it may be said, there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>none poorer than themselves, or who have no more than what
is absolutely necessary to support their families, or such as are
labouring hard, to spare out of their necessary expenses, what
will but just serve to pay their debts; or they who are reduced
to such straits as to depend upon others, so that they can call
nothing they have their own.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, this duty is incumbent;</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] On the rich, out of their abundance.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] On those who are in middle circumstances in the world,
who have a sufficiency to lay out in superfluous expenses:
And,</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] Even the poor ought to give a small testimony of their
gratitude to God, by sparing a little, if they can, out of what
they get in the world, for those who are poorer than themselves;
which, if it be but a few mites, it may be an acceptable
sacrifice to God, Luke xxi. 2, 4. and, if persons have nothing
before hand in the world, they ought to work for this end, as
well as to maintain themselves and families, Eph. iv. 28.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We are now to consider, who are to be reckoned objects
of our charity. To which it may be answered; Not the rich,
who stand in no need of it, from whom we may expect a sufficient
requital, Luke xiv. 12, 13, 14. nor those who are strong
and healthy, but yet make a trade of begging, because it is an
idle and sometimes a profitable way of living, 2 Thess. iii.
10-12. But such are to be relieved, who are not able to work;
especially if they were not reduced to poverty by their own
sloth and negligence, but by the providence of God not succeeding
their endeavours; and if, while they were able, they
were ready to all works of charity themselves, 1 Tim. v. 10. and
to these we may add, such who are related to us, either in the
bonds of nature, or in a spiritual sense, Gal. vi. 10. This leads
us to enquire,</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) What part, or proportion of our substance, we are to
apply to charitable uses? In answer to this, let it be considered,
that the circumstances of persons in the world being so various,
as well as their necessary occasions for extraordinary
expenses, it is impossible to give a general rule, to be observed
by all. However, it must be premised,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That our present contributions, ought not to preclude
all thoughts, about laying up for ourselves or families, for time
to come.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Whatever proportion we give of our gain in the world,
some abatements may reasonably be made for losses in trade;
especially if what we give was not determined, or laid aside,
for that use before the loss happened. As to what may farther
be observed concerning this matter, it ought to be left to
the impartial determination of every one, who is to act, as being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>sensible that he is accountable to God herein. The apostle
lays down one general rule; <i>Every man, according as he purposeth
in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity;
for God loveth a cheerful giver</i>, 2 Cor. ix. 7. But
though we pretend not to determine the exact proportion
which ought to be given, <i>viz.</i> whether it be a tenth part of
their profits, or more, or less; yet it is highly reasonable, that
every one should contribute as much in works of charity, as
he lays out in mere superfluities; or, at least, spare a part out
of his superfluous expenses, for charitable uses. And there
are some occasions which may call for large contributions.
Thus <i>the churches in Macedonia</i> are commended, not only for
their <i>giving according to</i>, but <i>beyond their power</i>, chap. viii.
1, 2, 3. <i>Three</i> things may be here considered,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, The extreme necessities of those whom we are bound
to take care of; and, sometimes, the distressed circumstances
of the church of God, in general, require larger contributions
than ordinary; which was the occasion of the Command mentioned
by our Saviour, of selling all, and giving to the poor,
which was put in practice in the infancy of the church, or the
first planting of the gospel, at Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, Extraordinary instances of the kindness of God, in
prospering us, either in worldly or spiritual concerns, beyond
our expectation, call for extraordinary expressions of gratitude
to God, in laying by for the poor, 1 Cor. xvi. 2.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, When we have committed great sins, or are under
very humbling providences, whether personal or national, as
being exposed to, or fearing the judgments of God, which
seem to be approaching; this calls for deep humiliation, and,
together therewith, proportionable acts of charity.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) We are now to consider, with what frame of spirit
works of charity are to be performed? To which, it may be
answered, that they are to be performed prudently, as our own
circumstances will permit, and the necessity of the object requires;
also seasonably, not putting this duty off till another
time, when the necessities of those, whom we are bound to relieve,
call for present assistance, Prov. ii. 28. It is also to be
done secretly, as not desiring to be seen of men, or commended
by them for it, Matt. vi. 3, 4, and cheerfully, 2 Cor. ix. 7.
also with tenderness and compassion to those whose necessities
call for relief, as considering how soon God can reduce us
to the same extremity which they are exposed to, who are the
objects of our charity. It ought to be done likewise with
thankfulness to God, that has made us givers, rather than receivers,
Acts x. 35. and, as a testimony of our love to Christ,
especially when we contribute to the necessities of his members,
Matt. x. 42.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CXLII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXLII.</span> <i>What are the sins forbidden in the eighth Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sins forbidden in the eighth Commandment, besides
the neglect of the duties required, are, theft, robbery,
man-stealing, and receiving any thing that is stolen, fraudulent
dealing, false weights and measures, removing landmarks,
injustice and unfaithfulness in contracts between man
and man, or in matters of trust; oppression, extortion, usury,
bribery, vexatious law-suits, unjust inclosures, and depopulations;
ingrossing commodities to enhance the price,
unlawful callings, and all other unjust, or sinful ways of
taking, or withholding from our neighbour what belongs to
him, or of enriching ourselves. Covetousness, inordinate
prizing and affecting worldly goods; distrustful and distracting
cares and studies in getting, keeping, and using them,
envying at the prosperity of others. As likewise idleness,
prodigality, wasteful gaming, and all other ways whereby
we do unduly prejudice our own outward estate; and defrauding
ourselves of the due use and comfort of that estate
which God hath given us.</p>

<p class='c011'>This Commandment forbids, in general all kind of theft;
and may include in it that which is very seldom called
by this name, to wit, the robbing of ourselves and families;
which we may be said to do, by neglecting our worldly calling,
or by the imprudent management thereof. Also, by lending
larger sums of money than our circumstances will well bear,
to those who are never like to pay it again; or, which is in effect
the same, by being surety for such. Moreover we rob
ourselves and families, by being profuse and excessive in our
expenses; and by consuming what we have, while pursuing
our pleasures more than business; or by gaming, whereby we
run the risque of losing part of our substance, and thereby reducing
ourselves, or others, to poverty. On the other hand,
we rob ourselves and families, when, out of a design to lay up
a great deal for the time to come, we deprive ourselves and
them, of the common necessaries of life, which is, in effect, to
starve for the present, to prevent our starving for the future.
But, passing this by, we shall consider this Commandment
more especially, as it respects our defrauding others; and this
is done,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. By taking away any part of their wealth, or worldly substance.
This is generally known by the name of theft, and
that, with the greatest severity, in proportion to its aggravations;
and they who are guilty of it, are, without repentance,
excluded from the kingdom of God, 1 Cor. vi. 9, 10. However,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>let it be considered, that every kind of theft does not deserve
an equal degree of punishment from men; for sometimes
hereby the owner of what was stolen, receives but little damage;
though in this case, some punishment, short of death,
ought to be inflicted, to reform the wicked person, and deter
him from going on in the breach of this Commandment, from
less to greater sins.</p>

<p class='c006'>By the law of God, a simple theft was punished with restitution
of double, and sometimes, four times as much as the
damage amounted to, which was sustained thereby, Exod. xxii.
1, 4, 7. Yet, in other cases, the theft was punished with death,
when it had in it some circumstances that aggravated it in an
uncommon degree; as if an house, which ought to be reckoned
a man’s castle, be broke open, and that, in the night-time,
when he is in no condition of defending himself, or his worldly
substance. In this case the law is not unjust, that punishes
the thief with death; and this is supposed in that law which
says, that he that kills such an one who <i>breaks up</i> his neighbour’s
house by night, shall have <i>no blood shed for him</i>, ver.
2. But, in other instances, confinement, and hard labour, may
be as effectual a way to put a stop to this sin; and is rather to
be chosen than punishment with death. Thus concerning this
Commandment, as broken by theft.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. It is farther broken, by unfaithfulness, or breach of trust;
whether the trust he devolved on us by nature, as that of parents
towards their children; or by contract, as that of servants,
who are entrusted with the goods and secrets of their masters;
or, that which is founded in the desire and request of those
who constitute persons executors to their wills, or guardians
to orphans, under age, provided they accept of this trust; I
say, if these violate their trust, by embezzling or squandering
away the substance of others, defrauding them, to enrich themselves.
This is not only theft, but perfidiousness, and highly
provoking to God; and deserves a more severe punishment
from men, than is usually inflicted.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. This Commandment may be said to be broken, by borrowing,
and not paying just debts; as the Psalmist says, <i>The
wicked borroweth and payeth not again</i>, Psal. xxxvii. 21. Nevertheless,
there are some cases in which a man is not guilty
hereof, though he borrows and does not pay, <i>viz.</i> If, when he
borrowed, there was a probability of his being able to repay it;
or otherwise, if he discovered his circumstances fully to him,
of whom he borrowed, to whom it would hereby appear, whether
there was any likelihood of paying him or not; or if he
gave full conviction, when he borrowed, that he was able to
pay, but the providence of God, without his own default, has
rendered him unable; in this case mercy is to be shewn him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and he is not to be reckoned a breaker of this Commandment.
However, a person is guilty of the breach hereof, in borrowing,
and not paying debts.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. If the borrower pretends his circumstances to be better
than they are, and so makes the lender believe, that, in a limited
time, he shall be able to repay him; when, in his own conscience,
he apprehends that there is no probability hereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. When a person was in such circumstances at the time of
his borrowing, that by industry in his calling, he might be able
to pay the creditor; but, by neglect of business, or embezzling
his substance, he renders himself unable to pay, such an one is
chargeable with the breach of this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. If pity be shewn, by compounding for a part, instead of
the whole debt, in case of present insolvency; though the
debtor, in form of law, be discharged, with the creditor’s consent;
yet the law of God and nature, obliges him to pay the
whole debt, if providence makes him able hereafter; or else
he can hardly be excused from the breach of this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'>This leads us to enquire, what judgment we may pass on
the Israelites <i>borrowing of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and
jewels of gold</i>; which we read of in Exod. xii. 35. whether
they were herein guilty of the breach of this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> The word<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> which we render <i>borrowed</i>, might as
well be rendered <i>asked</i>, or <i>demanded</i>. And so we must suppose,
that the Egyptians were so desirous that the Israelites
should be gone, apprehending, that if they continued, they
were all dead men, that they might have of them whatever
they demanded, as necessary for this expedition; and, if they
came back again, as they supposed they should, they would be
obliged to return them. If this be the sense of the Hebrew
word, there is no difficulty in the text, nor any appearance of
the breach of this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'>But since the sense of the word is indeterminate, signifying
to <i>demand</i>, as well as to <i>borrow</i>, as was before observed, God’s
order imports the former; though they might understand it in
the latter, as denoting a borrowing with a design to restore.
Therefore, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That they did this by God’s command, who has a right
to take away the goods that one possesses, if he pleases, and
give them to another; for he takes away nothing but his own.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Now, that they had his warrant for borrowing or demanding
these things of the Egyptians, appears from the second
verse.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The reason why God ordered them to do this, if we
look beyond his absolute sovereignty, was, because the Israelites
deserved them as wages, for their hard service; and this
might be reckoned a reward of the good offices that Joseph
had done to that kingdom; which had been long since forgotten.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) As to what concerns the Israelites, it is probable, they
expected nothing else but to return again, and restore to the
owners what they had borrowed of them, after they had sacrificed
to God in the wilderness; at least, they were wholly passive,
and disposed to follow the divine conduct, by the hand
of Moses. And when they were in the wilderness, they could
not restore what they had borrowed, since the owners thereof,
as is more than probable, were drowned in the Red Sea, whose
revenge and covetousness, as well as Pharaoh’s orders, prompted
them to follow them. Or if some of the owners might have
been heard of, as yet surviving, their right to what was borrowed
of them, was forfeited, by reason of the hostile pursuit
of Pharaoh and his hosts, which put them into a state of war.</p>

<p class='c006'>This may lead us farther to enquire, what judgment we may
pass on the many ravages and plunders that are generally made
by armies engaged in war; whether they may be reckoned a
breach of this Commandment? And,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] It is beyond dispute, that, if the war be unjust, as all
the blood that is shed, is murder, or a breach of the sixth
Commandment; so all the damage that is done by burning of
houses, or taking away the goods of those against whom it is
carried on, is a breach of this Commandment. But,</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] If we suppose the war to be just, and the damage done
only to those who are immediately concerned in it, and that it
is an expedient to procure peace; it is unquestionably lawful,
and no breach of this Commandment. Thus when the Israelites
were commanded to destroy the inhabitants of the land of
Canaan, as criminals, they were admitted to seize on the spoil
of other nations, who were remote from them, Deut. xx. 14,
15. when conquered by them.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] As for those plunders and robberies which are committed
on private persons, who are not concerned in the war any
otherwise than as subjects of the government, against which it
is undertaken; and especially, if their loss has no direct tendency
to procure peace; this can hardly be justified from being
a breach of this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. This Commandment is also broken by oppression;
whereby the rich may be said to rob, and even swallow up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>poor, Psal. xiv. 4. Psal. x. 9. Micah iii. 2, 3. Now there are
various ways by which persons may be said to oppress others.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. By engrossing those goods which are necessary for food
or clothing, thereby to enhance the price thereof, whereby the
poor are brought into great extremities.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. When persons enrich themselves out of the unmerciful
labour exacted of their servants, whom they will hardly suffer
to live, to eat the just reward of their service. Such a master
was Laban to Jacob, Gen. xxxi. 41, 42.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. When landlords turn their tenants out of their houses or
farms, when they find that they get a comfortable subsistence
by their industry, taking occasion from thence, to raise their
rent, in proportion to the success God gives them therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. When the rich make the poor suffer by long delays, to
pay their debts, that they may gain advantage by the improvement
of that money which they ought to have paid them.</p>

<p class='c006'>V. A person may be said to break this Commandment, by
engaging in unjust and vexatious law-suits. However, it is
to be owned, that going to law is not, at all times, unjust; for
it is sometimes a relief against oppression; and it is agreeable
to the law of nature for every one to defend his just rights;
and for this reason God appointed judges, (to determine such-like
causes) to whom the people were to have recourse, that
they might <i>shew them the sentence of judgment</i>, Deut. xvii. 8,
9. Nevertheless, we must sometimes conclude law-suits to
be oppressive; as,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. When the rich make use of the law, to prevent, or prolong
the payment of their debts, or to take away the rights of
the poor, who, as they suppose, will rather suffer injuries than
attempt to defend themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. When bribes are either given or taken, with a design to
pervert justice, 1 Sam. viii. 2. And to this we may add, that
the person who pleads an unrighteous cause, concealing the
known truth, perverting the sense of the law, or alleging
that for law or fact, which he knows not to be so; and the
judge who passes sentence against his conscience, respecting
the person of the rich, and brow-beating the poor; these are all
confederates in oppression; and such methods of proceeding,
are beyond dispute, a breach of this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> Our Saviour forbids going to law, though it were to
recover our just rights; when he says, <i>If any man will sue thee
at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also</i>,
Matt. v. 40.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied; that some things may be
omitted for prudential reasons, which would not otherwise be
unlawful to be done. Our Saviour does not forbid using our
endeavours, in a legal way, to recover our right in all cases;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>but more especially at that time, when his followers could
hardly expect to meet with justice. And, it may be, they
were oppressed by fines, or distress, laid on them, for their
embracing Christianity; in this case he advises them, patiently
to bear injuries, when they could hardly expect relief from
their unjust judges.</p>

<p class='c006'>VI. This Commandment is broken by extortion, or oppressive
usury. Thus it is said of the righteous man, <i>He putteth
not out his money to usury</i>, Psal. xv. 5. The word<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> signifies
<i>biting</i> usury; which is, beyond dispute, unlawful. We
have elsewhere considered in what cases the Israelites might
take usury, and when not<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a>. And, upon the whole, it is certainly
unlawful, to exact more than the legal rate or worth of
the loan of money; or to exact any usury of the poor; especially
for that which was borrowed to supply them with the
necessaries of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having considered in what instances this Commandment is
broken, we proceed to shew, what a person ought to do, who
has been guilty of the breach thereof, in any of the forementioned
instances, in order to his making restitution for the injuries
he has done to his neighbour. This ought always to
attend the exercise of sincere repentance in those who have
been guilty of this sin, of which we have an instance in Zaccheus,
Luke xix. 8. and the neglect hereof will be like a worm
at the root of ill gotten estates, and will be little better than a
continual theft.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 1. To this it is objected, that this may be a prejudice
to our reputation, by making our crime public, which before
was only known to ourselves.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied;</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That, what we do in this matter, is not really a reproach,
but an honour; and it is hardly to be supposed, that he, to
whom we perform so just and unexpected a duty, will be so
barbarous as to divulge or improve this against us, to our disadvantage.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. There are private ways of retaliation, whereby the injured
party may receive what is sent to him, in a way of restitution,
and not know from whom it comes; or, good turns may
be done to him, in a way of compensation for the damages he
has received, and he not know, that they are done with this
design; and, by this means, we disburden our consciences,
perform a necessary duty, and, at the same time, prevent the
supposed ill-consequences that might attend it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 2. It is farther objected, that sometimes the making
restitution is impracticable; as when the person injured is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>dead, and we know of none that has a right to receive it. And
sometimes we may have been guilty of so many instances of
fraud and oppression, and, that to such a great number of persons,
that it is next to impossible, to make restitution.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied; that when it is impossible
for us to make restitution to those whom we have injured; or,
when we know of none that survive them, who have a right
to receive it, the best expedient, I apprehend, we can make
use of, is, to give it to the poor; for, since it is not, in justice,
our own, we do, as it were, hereby give it to the Lord, who
is the original proprietor of all things.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sins forbidden in the ninth Commandment, are,
all prejudicing the truth, and the good name of our neighbours
as well as our own, especially in public judicature,
giving false evidence, suborning false witnesses, wittingly
appearing and pleading for an evil cause, out-facing and
over-bearing the truth, passing unjust sentence, calling evil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>good, and good evil, rewarding the wicked according to the
work of the righteous; and the righteous according to the
work of the wicked; forgery, concealing the truth, undue silence
in a just cause, and holding our peace when iniquity
calleth for either a reproof from ourselves, or complaint to
others; speaking the truth unseasonably, or maliciously to a
wrong end, or perverting it to a wrong meaning, or in doubtful
and equivocal expressions, to the prejudice of truth or
justice, speaking untruth, lying, slandering, back-biting, detracting,
tale-bearing, whispering, scoffing, reviling, rash,
harsh, and partial, censuring, misconstruing intentions,
words, and actions, flattering, vain-glorious boasting, thinking
or speaking too highly or too meanly of ourselves or
others, denying the gifts and graces of God, aggravating
smaller faults, hiding, excusing, or extenuating of sins when
called to a free confession, unnecessary discovering of infirmities,
raising false rumours, receiving and countenancing
evil reports, and stopping our ears against just defence, evil
suspicion, envying or grieving at the deserved credit of any,
endeavouring or desiring to impair it, rejoicing in their
disgrace and infamy, scornful contempt, fond admiration,
breach of lawful promises, neglecting such things as are of
good report, and practising or not avoiding ourselves or not
hindering, what we can in others, such things as procure an
ill name.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this Commandment we are to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. What are the duties required? These are,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Our endeavouring to promote truth in all we say or do;
and that, as to what either concerns ourselves, or others. As
to what concerns ourselves, we are to fence against every
thing that savours of deceit or hypocrisy; and, in our whole
conversation, endeavour to be what we pretend to be; or to
speak nothing but what we know, or believe to be true, upon
good evidence, the contrary whereunto is lying. As to what
concerns others, we must not neglect to reprove sin in them,
how much soever our worldly interest may lie at stake. Thus
Azariah reproved Uzziah, 2 Chron. xxvi. 18. and Elijah,
Ahab; though this could not but be an hazardous attempt in
each of them. Moreover, we must endeavour to undeceive
others, who are mistaken; especially if the error, they are
liable to, be of such a nature, that it endangers the loss of their
salvation. We are also to vindicate those who are reproached
by others, to the utmost of our power, according as the cause
will admit of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. This Commandment obliges us, to endeavour to promote
our own, and our neighbour’s good name.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>(1.) Our own good name; which consists, not in our having
the applause of the world, but in our deserving the just esteem
thereof, and in our being loved and valued for our usefulness
to mankind in general. And this esteem is not to be
gained by commending ourselves, or doing any thing, but
what we engage in with a good conscience, and the fear of
God. And in order hereto, we must, take heed that we do
not contract an intimacy with those, whose conversation is a
reproach to the gospel, Prov. xxviii. 7. Also we must render
good for evil, and not give occasion to those, who watch
for our halting, to insult us as to any thing, besides unavoidable
infirmities, 1 Pet. ii. 12. Phil. iv. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>This degree of honour in the world, we ought first to endeavour
to gain, especially so far as it is necessary to our
honouring God, and being useful to others. And then we
must be careful to maintain our good name; forasmuch as the
loss thereof, especially, in those who have made a public profession
of religion, will reflect dishonour on the ways of God,
from whence his enemies will take occasion to blaspheme, 2
Sam. xii. 14. But if all our endeavours to maintain our
character and reputation are to no purpose; being, nevertheless,
followed with reproach as well as hatred and malice,
from an unjust and censorious world; let us look to it, that if
we <i>suffer reproach</i>, it be <i>wrongfully; not as evil doers, but for
keeping a good conscience in the sight of God</i>; which may be
a means to make those that reproach us, <i>ashamed</i>, 1 Pet. iii.
16. Moreover, let us count the reproach of Christ, that is,
for his sake, a glory, chap. iv. 14. Acts v. 41. Again, let us
always value their good opinion most, who are Christ’s best
friends; and expect little else but ill treatment from his enemies;
and then we shall be less disappointed, when we are exposed
to it. And let us not decline any thing that is our duty,
in which the honour of God, and the welfare of his people, is
concerned, for fear of reproach; but in this case, leave our
good name in Christ’s hand; whose providence is concerned,
for, and takes care of, the honour, as well as the wealth and
outward estate of his people.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We are to endeavour to maintain the good name of
others; and in order thereto, we must render to them those
marks of respect and honour, which their character, and advancement
in gifts, or grace, calls for; yet without being
guilty of servile flattery or dissimulation. And if they are in
danger of doing any thing that may forfeit their good name,
we are carefully to reprove them, while we have a due regard
to any good thing that is in them, towards the Lord their God;
and, in maintaining their good name, we are to conceal their
faults, when we may do it without betraying the interest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Christ; and especially when the honour of God, and their
good, is, by this means, better promoted, than by divulging
them, 1 Pet. iv. 8. Prov. xvii. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, this is not without some exceptions; and therefore
it may be observed, that we are not to conceal the crimes
committed by others.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] If private admonition for scandalous sins committed,
prove ineffectual, and the discovering them to others may
make the offender ashamed, and promote his reformation; then
we are not to conceal his crimes, though the divulging them
may lessen the esteem which others have of him, since it is
better for him to be ashamed before men, than perish in his
hypocrisy, Matt. xviii. 16, 17.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] If the crime committed be such, that shame, and the
loss of his good name, be a just punishment due to it, we are
not to conceal it, thereby to stop the course of justice.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] When the honour and good name of an innocent person
cannot be maintained, unless by divulging the crimes of
the guilty, he that, in this case, has forfeited his good name,
ought to lose it, rather than he that has not.</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall close this head by considering what reason we
have to endeavour to maintain the good name of others. To
take away our neighbour’s good name, is to take away one of
the most valuable privileges he is possessed of, the loss whereof
may be inexpressibly detrimental to him. And sometimes
it may affect his secular interest; so that hereby we may be
said to take away his wealth and outward estate, and prevent
his usefulness in that station of life in which providence has
fixed him. Accordingly we are to express a due concern for
the honour and reputation of others as well as ourselves.
Thus concerning the duties required in this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We proceed to consider the sins forbidden therein; which
are contained in that general expression bearing false witness:
This may either respect ourselves or others. A person may be
said to bear false witness against himself; and that either in
thinking too highly or meanly of himself; in the former respect
we value ourselves, or our supposed attainments, either in
gifts or graces, too much, in which we are, for the most part,
mistaken, and pass a wrong judgment on them, and are ready
to say, with the church at Laodicea, <i>I am rich and increased
with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that we
are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked</i>,
Rev. iii. 17. These, on the one hand, mistake the common
gifts of the Spirit, for grace, and conclude themselves to be
something, when they are nothing: And, on the other hand,
many conclude, that they have no grace, and rank themselves
among hypocrites and unbelievers, when their hearts are right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>with God, and they have had large experience of the powerful
influences of his Spirit, but are not sensible thereof. Thus
Christ says to the church in Smyrna, <i>I know thy poverty; but
thou art rich</i>, chap. ii. 9. In these respects persons may be
said to bear false witness against themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that which is principally forbidden in this Commandment,
is, a person’s bearing false witness against his neighbour;
and that when he either endeavours to deceive, or do
him prejudice, as to his reputation in the world; the one is
called lying, the other back-biting or slandering. As to the
former of these, when we speak that which is contrary to what
we know to be truth, with a design to deceive, this is what we
call telling a lye; and when we act that which is contrary to
truth, it may be deemed a practical lye; both of which are
very great sins.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. A person is guilty of lying, when he speaks that which is
contrary to truth, with a design to deceive: This the old prophet
at Bethel did, to the prophet of the Lord; upon which
occasion it is said, that he <i>lyed unto him</i>, 1 Kings xiii. 18.
That this may be farther considered, let it be observed, that it
is not barely a speaking what is contrary to truth; for that a
person may do, and be guiltless; as,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] When there is some circumstance that discovers him to
speak <i>ironically</i>; and therefore he does not appear to have a
design to deceive those, to whom he addresses his discourse.
Thus when the prophet Micaiah said to Ahab, <i>Go and prosper,
for the Lord shall deliver it</i>, viz. <i>Ramoth-Gilead, into the hands
of the kings</i>, chap. xxii. 15. it is plain that he spake the language
of the false prophets, and that Ahab understood him in
this sense, or suspected that he spake <i>ironically</i>; and therefore
says, <i>How many times shall I adjure thee, that thou tell me
nothing but that which is true?</i> ver. 16. Upon which, the
prophet tells him, without an <i>irony</i>, though in a metaphorical
way, which Ahab easily understood; <i>I saw all Israel scattered
upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: And the
Lord said, These have no master, let them return every man to
his house in peace</i>, ver. 17. which was an intimation, that, if
he went up to Ramoth-Gilead, he should fall in battle: Upon
which occasion Ahab says to Jehoshaphat, <i>Did I not tell thee,
that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil</i>, ver.
18. by which it appears, that the prophet did not deceive him,
notwithstanding the mode of speaking, which he at first made
use of, without considering it as an irony, seemed to intimate
as much.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] A person may speak that which is contrary to truth, being
imposed on himself, without any design to deceive another.
This cannot, indeed, according to the description before given,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>be properly called a lie: However, he may sin by asserting
too positively, that which he thinks to be true from probable
circumstances, or uncertain information; especially if what he
reports, carries in it that which is matter of scandal, or censure.
This was the case of Job’s friends, who did not tell a lie against
their own consciences: Nevertheless, they were too
peremptory in charging him with hypocrisy, without sufficient
ground; therefore God imputes <i>folly</i> to them, in that <i>they had
not spoken of him the thing which was right</i>, Job xlii. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it may be enquired, whether a person, who designs not
to deceive, nor speaks contrary to the dictates of his own conscience;
yet if he promises to do a thing, and does it not, is
guilty of lying? To which it may be replied,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That if a person promises to do a thing, which, at the
same time he really designs, and afterwards uses all the endeavours
he could, to fulfil his promise, and something unforeseen
happens, in the course of providence, which prevents the execution
thereof, he cannot, properly speaking, be said to be guilty
of a lie; though we ought not to promise any thing but
upon this supposition, that God enables us to perform it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, If a person intends to do a thing, and, accordingly,
promises to do it, but afterwards sees some justifiable reason to
alter his mind, he is not guilty of a lie; since all creatures are
supposed to be mutable. Thus the angels told Lot, that they
would <i>abide in the street all night</i>; but afterwards, upon his
intreaty, they <i>went into the house with him</i>, Gen. xix. 2,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. And our Saviour, when he walked with his disciples to
Emmaus, <i>made as though he would have gone farther: But
they constrained him, saying, abide with us; and he went in to
tarry with them</i>, Luke xxiv. 28, 29. But, notwithstanding this
if a person promises to do any thing that is of advantage to another,
as the paying a just debt, <i>&amp;c.</i> it is not a sufficient excuse,
to clear him from the guilt of sin, if he pretends that he has
altered his mind, supposing that it is in his power to fulfil
it: For this is, indeed, a breach of the eighth Commandment,
and in some respects, it will appear to him, to be a violation
of this.</p>

<p class='c006'>That we may more particularly speak concerning the sin of
lying which multitudes are chargeable with, let it be observed,
that there are three sorts of lies,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, When a person speaks that which is contrary to truth,
and the dictates of his own conscience, with a design to cover
a fault or excuse himself or others: This we generally call
an officious lie<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, When a person speaks that which is contrary to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>known truth, in a jesting way; and embellishes his discourse
with his own fictions, designing hereby to impose on others:
This they are guilty of, who invent false news, or tell stories
for truth, which they know to be false. This is to lie in a jesting,
ludicrous manner<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, There is a pernicious lie, <i>viz.</i> when a person raises
and spreads a false report with a design to do injury to another;
which is a complicated crime, and the worst sort of
lying<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here there are two or three enquiries which it may not be
improper to take notice of;</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Whether the midwives were guilty of an officious lie,
when they told Pharaoh, in Exod. i. 19. that <i>the Hebrew women
were delivered of their children ere they came in unto them</i>;
concerning whom it is said, in the following verse, <i>that God
dealt well with the midwives</i> for this report, which carries in it
the appearance of a lie.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That they seem not to have been guilty of a lie; for it
is not improbable, that God in mercy to the Hebrew women,
and their children, might give them uncommon strength; so
that they might be delivered without the midwives assistance:
Or,</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] If this was not the case of all the Hebrew women, but
only of some, or many of them, the midwives report contains
only a concealing part of the truth, while they related in other
respects, that which was matter of fact. Now a person is not
guilty of telling a lie, who does not discover all that he knows.
There is a vast difference between concealing a part of the
truth, and telling that which is directly false. No one is
obliged to tell all he knows, to one, who, he is sure, will make
a bad use of it. This seems to be the case of the midwives;
and therefore their action was justifiable, and commended by
God, they being not guilty, properly speaking, of an officious
lye.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Another enquiry is, what judgment we must pass concerning
the actions of Rahab, the harlot, who invented an officious
lye, to save the spies from those who pursued them, in
Josh. ii. 4, 5. it is said, <i>she took the two men and hid them</i>;
and, at the same time, pretended, so those who were sent to
enquire of her concerning them, that <i>she wist not whence they
were</i>; but that they <i>went out of the city about the time of the
shutting of the gate; though whither they went she knew not</i>.
The main difficulty we have to account for, is what the apostle
says, in which he seems to commend this action, in Heb. xi.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>31. <i>By faith Rahab perished not with them that believed not,
when she had received the spies with peace.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To which it may be replied, that the apostle says,
indeed, that she <i>received the spies with peace</i>, that is, she protected,
and did not betray them into the hand of their enemies:
But this act of faith does not relate directly to the lie that she
invented to conceal them; for, doubtless, she would have been
more clear from the guilt of sin, had she refused to give the
messengers any answer relating to them, and so had given them
leave to search for them, and left the event hereof to providence.
This, indeed, was a very difficult duty; for it might
have endangered her life; and her choosing to secure them
and herself, by inventing this lie, brought with it a degree of
guilt, and was an instance of the weakness of her faith in this
respect.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, on the other hand, that faith which the apostle commends
in her, respects some other circumstances attending this
action; and, accordingly, it is not said, that <i>by faith</i> she made
the report to the messengers concerning the spies; but <i>she received
them with peace</i>: And there are several things in which
her faith was very remarkable, as,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That she was confident that <i>the Lord would give them
the land</i>, which they were contending for, Josh. ii. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] In that she makes a just inference relating to this matter,
from the wonders that God had wrought for them in the
red sea, ver. 10. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] In that noble confession which she makes, that <i>the
Lord their God, is God in heaven above, and the earth beneath</i>,
ver. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] Her faith appears, in that she put herself under their
protection, and desired to take her lot with them; which was
done at the hazard of her own life; which she might have
saved, and probably, have received a reward, had she betrayed
them. This, I conceive to be a better vindication of Rahab’s
conduct, than that which is alleged, by some who suppose,
that by entering into confederacy with the spies, she put herself
into a state of war with her own country-men, and so was
not obliged to speak truth to the men of Jericho; since this
would have many ill consequences attending it, and give too
much countenance to persons deceiving others, under pretence
of being in a state of war with them. And, as to what the Papists
say in her vindication, that a good design will justify a
bad action; that it is not true in fact; and therefore not to be
applied to her case.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) It might be farther enquired, what judgment ought we
to pass on the method that Jacob took to obtain the blessing,
when he told his father, <i>I am Esau, thy first-born; I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>done according as thou badest me</i>, Gen. xxvii. 19. whether he
was guilty of a lie herein?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> There is not the least doubt but that he was. Some,
indeed, endeavour to excuse him, by alleging, that he had,
before this, bought the birth-right of Esau; and, upon this account
he calls himself Isaac’s first-born. But this will not clear
him from the guilt of a lye; since it was an equivocation, and
spoken with a design to deceive. Others own it to have been
a lye; but extenuate it, from the consideration of God’s having
designed the blessing for him before he was born, chap.
xxv. 31. But these do not at all mend the matter: For,
though God may permit, or over-rule the sinful actions of men
to bring about his own purpose; yet this does not, in the least,
extenuate their sin.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which may therefore be observed, with reference to this
action of his, and the consequence thereof, is, that good men
are sometimes liable to sinful infirmities, as Jacob was; who,
was followed with many sore rebukes of providence, which
made the remaining part of his life very uneasy.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, In his living in exile twenty years, with Laban, an hard
master, and an unjust and unnatural father-in-law.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, In the great distress that befel him in his return; occasioned
first by Laban’s pursuit of him, and then by the
tidings that he received of his brother Esau’s <i>coming out to
meet him</i>; (being prompted hereto by revenge which he had
long harboured in his breast) <i>with four hundred men</i>, from whom
he expected nothing less than the destruction of himself, and
his whole family.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, He did not obtain deliverance from the hand of God
without <i>great wrestling</i>, chap. xxxii. 24-25. and this attended
with <i>weeping</i>, as well as <i>making supplication</i>, Hos. xii. 4. and,
though he prevailed, and so obtained the blessing, and therewith
forgiveness of his sin; yet God so ordered it, that he
should carry the mark thereof upon him, as long as he lived,
by touching the hollow of his thigh, which occasioned an incurable
lameness.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) Another enquiry is, whether the prophet Elijah did not
tell a lie to the Syrian host, who were before Dothan, in quest
of him, when he said, in 2 Kings vi. 19. <i>This is not the way,
neither is this the city: Follow me, and I will bring you to the
man you seek. But he led them to Samaria?</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> If what he says to them be duly considered, it will
appear not to be a lie; for he told them nothing but what
proved true, according to the import of his words; for,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, He does not say, I am not the man ye seek, which would
have been a lie; neither does he say, the man is not here:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>but he tells them, <i>I will lead you to the place where ye shall
find him</i>, or have him discovered and presented before you.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, When he says, <i>This is not the way; neither is this the
city</i>; he does not say, this is not the way to Dothan; neither
is this the city so called; for then they would have been able
to have convicted him of a lie; for they knew that they were
at Dothan before they were struck with blindness: But the
plain meaning of his words is, that this is not your way to find
him; since the men of this city will not deliver him to you;
but <i>I will lead you to the place where you shall see him</i>; and <i>so
he led them to Samaria</i>, upon which their eyes were opened,
and they saw him: So that this was not a lie. And the reason
of his management was, that the king of Israel, and the
Syrian host, might be convinced, that they were poor creatures
in God’s hand, and that he could easily turn their counsels into
foolishness, and cause their attempts to miscarry with shame,
as well as disappointment.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) It may be farther enquired, whether the apostle Paul
was guilty of a lie; when, being charged, in Acts xxiii. 4, 5.
with <i>reviling God’s high priest</i>, he says, <i>I wist not that he was
the high priest</i>? How was it possible that he should entertain
any doubt concerning his being the high priest; which none,
who were present, could, in the least, question?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> We may suppose, that the apostle, when he says, <i>I
wist not that he was the high priest</i>, intends nothing else, but
I do not own him to be the high priest, as you call him; for
he is not an high priest of God’s appointing or approving;
which, had he been, he would have acted more becoming that
character; and then I should have had no occasion to have told
him, <i>God shall smite thee, thou whited wall</i>; for that would have
been a <i>reviling him</i>; since I know that scripture very well, that
says, <i>Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people</i>; therefore
he intimates, that, though he was an high priest of man’s
making, he was not one of God’s approving; and accordingly
he was to be treated with contempt, instead of that regard
which was formerly paid to the high priests, when they were
better men, and acted more agreeable to their character. No
one, that deserves to be called God’s high priest, would have
ordered a prisoner, who came to be tried for his life, instead
of making his defence, to be smitten on the mouth.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, suppose we render the words agreeably to our translation,
I did not understand that he was the high priest, he may
be vindicated from the charge of telling a lie, if we consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That this was a confused assembly, and not a regular
court of judicature, in which the judge, or chief magistrate, is
known to all, by the place in which he sits, or the part he acts
in trying causes.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span><i>2dly</i>, The high priest, in courts of judicature, was not known
by any robe or distinct habit that he wore, as judges now are;
for he never wore any other but his common garments, which
were the same that other people wore, except when he ministered
in offering gifts and sacrifices in the temple. Therefore
the apostle could not know him by any distinct garment that
he wore.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Through the corruption of the times, the high priest
was changed almost every year, according to the will of the
chief governor, who advanced his own friends to that dignity,
and oftentimes sold it for money; it is therefore probable,
that Ananias had not been long high-priest; and Paul was
now a stranger at Jerusalem, and so might not know that he
was high priest. Thus, if we take the words in this sense, in
which they are commonly understood, the apostle may be sufficiently
vindicated from the charge of telling a lie.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) It may be farther enquired, what judgment we may
pass concerning David’s pretence, when he came to Abimelech,
in 1 Sam. xxi. 2. that <i>the king commanded him a business</i>,
<i>which no one was to know any thing of</i>; and that he had <i>appointed
his servants to such and such a place</i>; and also of his
<i>feigning himself mad</i>, before the king of Gath, ver. 13. which
dissimulation can be reckoned no other than a practical lie.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> In both these instances he must be allowed to have
sinned, and therefore not proposed as a pattern to us; and all
that can be inferred from it is, that there is a great deal of the
corruption of nature remaining in the best of God’s people.
What he told Abimelech was certainly a lye; and all that he
expected to gain by it, was only a supply of his present necessities;
the consequence whereof was, the poor man’s losing his
life, together with all the priests’, except Abiathar, by Saul’s
inhumanity. And David seems to be truly sensible of this sin,
as appears from Psal. xxxiv. which, as is intimated in the title
thereof, was penned on this occasion; in which he arms others
against it, in ver. 13. <i>Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips
from speaking guile</i>: And in ver. 18. he seems to relate his
own experience, when he says, <i>The Lord is nigh unto them
that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as be of a contrite
spirit.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>As to his behaviour before the king of Gath, which was a
visible lie, discovered in his actions; it can, by no means, be
excused from being a breach of this Commandment. It is, indeed,
alleged by some, to extenuate his fault; that he was
afraid that his having killed Goliah, would have induced
Achish to take away his life; as appears from what is said in
ver. 11, 12. Nevertheless, it may be considered as an aggravation
of his sin,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>[1.] That his fear seems to have been altogether groundless;
for, why should he suppose that the king of Gath would break
through all the laws of arms and honour, since Goliah had
been killed in a fair duel, the challenge having first been given
by himself? why then should David fear that he would kill
him for that, more than any other hostilities committed in war?
Besides, it is plain from what Achish says, in ver. 15. <i>Have I
need of mad-men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the
mad-man in my presence? should this fellow come into mine
house?</i> that the king of Gath was so far from designing to
revenge Goliah’s death on him, that he intended to employ
him in his service, and take him into his house; but this mean
action of his made him despised by all; for it seems probable,
by Achish’s saying, <i>Have ye brought this fellow to play the
mad-man?</i> that he perceived it to be a feigned, and not a real
distraction. And this was overruled by the providence of God,
to let the Philistines know, that the greatest hero is but a low-spirited
man, if his God be not with him.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] If we suppose that there had been just ground for his
fear, the method taken to secure himself, contained a distrust of
providence; which would, doubtless, have delivered him without
his dissembling, or thus demeaning himself, or using such
an indirect method in order thereunto. Thus concerning the
violation of this Commandment, by speaking that which is
contrary to truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. This Commandment is farther broken, by acting that
which is contrary to truth; which is what we call hypocrisy:
And this may be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) As that which is a reigning sin, inconsistent with a
state of grace; in which respect an hypocrite is opposed to a
true believer. Such make a fair shew of religion; but it is
with a design to be seen of men, Matt. vi. 5. They are sometimes,
indeed, represented as <i>seeking</i> God, and <i>enquiring early</i>,
or with a kind of earnestness after him, when under his afflicting
hand; but this is deemed no other than a <i>flattering him
with their mouth, and a lying unto him with their tongues</i>;
inasmuch as <i>their heart is not right with him</i>, Psal. lxxviii.
34,-37. And elsewhere, they are said to <i>love the praise of
men more than the praise of God</i>, John xii. 43.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) It may be farther considered, as that which believers are
sometimes chargeable with, which is an argument that they are
sanctified but in part; but this rather respects some particular
actions, and not the tenor of their conversation: Thus the apostle
Paul charges Peter with dissimulation, Gal. ii. 11,-13.
though he was far from deserving the character of an hypocrite,
as to his general conversation. And our Saviour cautions
his disciples against hypocrisy, as that which they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>in danger of being overtaken with, Luke xii. 1. though he
does not charge them with it as a reigning sin, as he did the
Scribes and Pharisees, whom he compares to <i>painted sepulchres</i>,
Matt. xxiii. 27, 28. nor were they such as the apostle speaks
of, whom he calls <i>double-minded men, who are unstable in all
their ways</i>, James i. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to that hypocrisy which we may call a reigning sin, this
may be known,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] By a person’s accommodating himself to all those whom
he converses with, how much soever this may tend to the dishonour
of Christ and the gospel: And this may give us occasion
to enquire,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>First</i>, Whether the apostle Paul was in any respects, chargeable
with this sin, when he says, in 1 Cor. ix. 20-22. <i>Unto
the Jews, I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to
them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might
gain them that are under the law; to them that are without
law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under
the law to Christ) that I might gain them that are without
law. To the weak, became I as weak, that I might gain the
weak; I am made all things to all men, that I might by all
means save some.</i> For the understanding of this scripture,
and vindicating the apostle from the charge of hypocrisy, let
it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That this compliance he here speaks of, was not with
a design to gain the applause of the world, but to serve the
interest of Christ; neither did he connive at, or give countenance
to, that false worship, or those sinful practices of any,
that were contrary to the faith, or purity of the gospel. Therefore
when he says, <i>Unto the Jews, I became as a Jew</i>; he does
not intend that he gave them the least ground to conclude,
that it was an indifferent matter, whether they adhered to, or
laid aside the observation of the ceremonial law: For, he
expressly tells some of the church at Galatia, who were supposed
to Judaize, that this was contrary to the <i>liberty wherewith
Christ</i> had <i>made them free, a being again entangled with
the yoke of bondage</i>; and that <i>if they circumcised, Christ
should profit them nothing; and</i>, that they were <i>fallen from
grace</i>; that is, turned aside from the faith of the gospel, Gal.
v. 1,-4. Therefore, in this sense he did not become as a Jew,
to the Jews. Neither did he so far comply with the Gentiles,
as to give them ground to conclude, that the superstition and
idolatry, which they were guilty of, was an harmless thing, and
might still be practised by them. Therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, The meaning of his compliance with the Jews or
Gentiles, is nothing else but this; that whatever he found
praise-worthy in them, he commended; and if, in any instances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>they were addicted to their former rites, or modes of worship,
he endeavoured to draw them off from them, not by a
severe, and rigid behaviour as censuring, refusing to converse
with, or reproaching them, for their weakness; but using kind
and gentle methods, designing rather to inform than discourage
them; while at the same time, he was far from approving
of, or giving countenance to any thing that was sinful in
them, or unbecoming the gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Secondly</i>, From what has been before said concerning an
hypocrite’s being one who performs religious duties with a design
to be seen of men, as our Saviour says of the Pharisees,
that <i>they love to stand praying in the synagogues, or in the
corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men</i>, Matth.
vi. 6. We may enquire, what may be said in vindication of
the prophet Daniel, from the charge of hypocrisy? concerning
whom it is said, in Dan. vi. 10. that when Darius had <i>signed
a decree</i> prohibiting any one from asking <i>a petition of any god
or man, save of the king, he</i> should <i>be cast into the den of
lions: He went into his house; and his windows being open
in his chamber, towards Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees
three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God,
as he did aforetime</i>. In answer to this we may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That this was not done to gain the esteem or applause
of men, which they are charged with, who are guilty of hypocrisy;
but he did it in contempt of that vile decree of the
Persian monarch.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, He did it at the peril of his life; and hereby discovered,
that he had rather be cast into the den of lions, than give
occasion to any to think that he complied with the king in his
idolatrous decree.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Though it is said, that <i>he prayed, and gave thanks before
his God, as he did</i> aforetime; yet this is not to be understood
as though he set open his windows aforetime; so that
his praying publicly at this time, was to shew that he was neither
ashamed, nor afraid to own his God, whatever it cost
him; therefore he was so far from being guilty of hypocrisy,
that this is one of the most noble instances of zeal for the
worship of the true God, that we find recorded in scripture.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Hypocrisy is a reigning sin when we boast of the high
attainments in gifts or grace, or set too great a value on ourselves,
because of the performance of some religious duties,
while we neglect others, wherein the principal part of true godliness
consists. Thus the Pharisee <i>paid tithe of mint, annise,
and cummin</i>, while he <i>omitted the weightier matters of the law;
judgment, mercy and faith</i>, chap. xxiii. 23, 24.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] It farther consists, in exclaiming against, and censuring
others, for lesser faults, while we allow of greater in ourselves;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>like those whom our Saviour speaks of, who <i>behold the mote
that is in their brother’s eye, but consider not the beam that is
in their own</i>, Matt. vii. 3, 5. or, according to that proverbial
way of speaking, <i>strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel</i>. These
are very fond of exposing the ignorance of others; though
they have no experimental, saving knowledge of divine truth
in themselves; or they are very forward, to blame the coldness
and lukewarmness which they see in some, while at the
same time, that zeal which they express in their whole conduct,
is rather to advance themselves, than the glory of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] When persons make a gain of godliness, 1 Tim. vi. 5.
or of their pretensions to it. Thus Balaam prophesied for a
reward; and accordingly it is said, that he <i>loved the wages of
unrighteousness</i>, 2 Pet. i. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. When persons make a profession of religion, because it
is uppermost, and are ready to despise and cast it off, when it
is reproached, or they are like to suffer for it. Thus the Pharisees,
how much soever they seemed to embrace Christ, when
attending on John’s ministry; yet afterwards, when they saw
that this was contrary to their secular interest, they were
<i>offended in him</i>, and prejudiced against him; and therefore
they say, <i>Have any of the rulers, or of the Pharisees, believed
on him</i>, John vii. 48.</p>

<p class='c006'>This sin of hypocrisy, which is a practical lie, has a tendency
to corrupt and vitiate all our pretensions to religion. It
is like the <i>dead flie</i>, mentioned by Solomon, <i>that causeth the
ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour</i>,
Eccl. x. 1. and it will, in the end, bring on those who are
guilty of it, many sore judgments; some of which are spiritual.
Thus it is said of the Heathen, that <i>because, when they knew
God, they glorified him not as God</i>, and <i>did not like to retain
him in their knowledge; he gave them up to a reprobate mind,
to do those things that are not convenient</i>, &amp;c. Rom. i. 21, 22,
28. And as for the false hope, and vain confidence, which
the hypocrite entertains, this shall leave him in despair and
confusion, Job viii. 13,-15. and be attended with unspeakable
horror of conscience, chap. xxvii. 18. Isa. xxxiii. 14.
Upon which account such are said to <i>heap up wrath</i>, and bring
on themselves a greater degree of condemnation than others,
Job xxxvi. 13. Matt. xxiii. 14. Thus we have considered
this Commandment as broken by speaking or acting that
which is contrary, or prejudicial, to truth; which leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. To consider it as forbidding our doing that which is injurious
to our neighbour’s good name, either by words or actions;
and this is done two ways, either before his face, or
behind his back.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Doing injury to another, by speaking against him, before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>his face. It is true, we give him hereby the liberty of vindicating
himself. Nevertheless, if the thing be false, which is
alleged against him, proceeding from malice and envy, it is a
crime of a very heinous nature; and this is done,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) By those, who, in courts of judicature, commence; and
carry on malicious prosecutions, in which the plaintiff, the
witness, the advocate that manages the cause, the jury that
bring in a false verdict, and the judge that passes sentence
contrary to law, or evidence, as well as the dictates of his own
conscience, with a design to crush and ruin him, who is maliciously
prosecuted; these are all notoriously guilty of the
breach of this Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) They may be said to do that which is injurious to our
neighbour’s good name, who reproach them in common conversation;
which is a sin too much committed in this licentious
age, as though men were not accountable to God for
what they speak, as well as other parts of the conduct of life.
There are several things which persons make the subject of
their reproach, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] The defect and blemishes of nature; such as lameness,
blindness, deafness, impediment of speech, meanness of capacity,
or actions, which proceed from a degree of distraction.
Thus many suppose that the apostle Paul was reproached for
some natural deformity in his body, or impediment in his
speech, which is inferred from what he says, when he represents
some as speaking to this purpose; <i>His letters, say they,
are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and
his speech contemptible</i>, 2 Cor. x. 10. And elsewhere, he
commends the Galatians for not despising him on this account;
<i>My temptation which was in my flesh, ye despised nor rejected;
but ye received me as an angel of God, even as Christ
Jesus</i>, Gal. iv. 14.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we may take occasion to speak something of the childrens
sin, who reproached Elisha for his baldness, and the
punishment that ensued upon it; namely, his <i>cursing them in
the name of the Lord</i>; and <i>two and forty</i> of them being <i>torn
in pieces by two she-bears out of the wood</i>, in 2 Kings ii. 23,
24. It may be enquired, by some, whether this was not too
great an instance of passion in that holy man, and too severe
a punishment inflicted; inasmuch as they who reproached him,
are called <i>little children</i>. To this it may be answered,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That the children were not so little, as not to be able
to know their right hand from their left, or to discern between
good and evil; for such are not usually trusted out of their
parents sight; nor would they have gathered themselves together
in a body, or went some distance from the city, on
purpose to insult the prophet, as it is plain they did, understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>that he was to come there at that time. This argues
that they were boys of sufficient age, to commit the most presumptuous
sin; and therefore not too young to suffer such a
punishment as ensued thereupon.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, Their sin was great, in that they mocked a grave old
man, who ought to have been honoured for his age, and a
prophet, whom they should have esteemed for his character;
and in despising him, they despised God, that called and sent
him.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Bethel, where they lived, was the chief seat of idolatry,
in which these children had been trained up; and it was a
prevailing inclination to it, together with an hatred of the true
religion, that occasioned their reproaching and casting contempt
on the prophet.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, The manner of expression argues a great deal of profaneness,
<i>Go up thou bald head</i>; that is, either go up to Bethel,
speaking in an insulting way, as though they should say, You
may go there, but you will not be regarded by them; for they
value no such men as you are; or rather, it is as though they
should say, you pretend that your predecessor Elijah is gone
up to heaven, do you go up after him, that you may trouble
us no longer with your prophecies; so that those children,
though young in years, were hardened in sin; and this was
not so much an occasional mocking of the prophet for his
baldness, as a public contrivance, and tumultuous opposition
to his ministry; which is a very great crime, and accordingly,
was attended with a just resentment in the prophet, and that
punishment which was inflicted as the consequence thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>The aggravations of this sin of reproaching persons for their
natural infirmities, are very great. For, it is a finding fault
with the workmanship of the God of nature, the thinking
meanly of a person for that which is not chargeable on him as
a crime, and which he can, by no means redress. It is a censuring
those who are, in some respects, objects of compassion;
especially if the reproach be levelled against the defects of the
mind, or any degree of distraction; and it argues a great deal
of pride and unthankfulness to God, for those natural endowments
which we have received from him, though we do not
improve them to his glory.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Some reproach persons for their sinful infirmities, and
that in such a way, as that they are styled <i>fools</i>, who <i>make a
mock of sin</i>, Prov. xiv. 9. This is done,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, When we reflect on persons for sins committed before
their conversion, which they have repented of, and God has
forgiven; and accordingly they should not be now charged
against them, as a matter of reproach. Thus the Pharisee
reproached the poor penitent woman, who stood weeping at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>our Saviour’s feet, and said within himself; <i>If this man were
a prophet, he would have known what manner of woman this
is that toucheth him, for she is a sinner</i>, Luke vii. 37-39.
which respected not her present, but her former condition.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, When they reproach them with levity of spirit, for the
sins they are guilty of at present; as when the shameful actions
of a drunken man are made the subject of laughter;
which ought not to be thought of without regret or pity.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> To this it may be objected, that sin renders a person
vile, and is really a reproach to him; and therefore it may
be charged upon him as such; especially since it is said, concerning
the righteous man; <i>in his eyes a vile person is contemned</i>,
Psal. xv. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> We are far from asserting, that it is a sin to reprove
sin, and shew the person who commits it his vileness, and the
reason he has to reproach and charge himself with it, and loath
himself for it; therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, The contempt that is to be cast on a vile person, does
not consist in making him the subject of laughter, as though
it was a light matter for him thus to dishonour God as he
does; for this should occasion grief in all true believers, as the
Psalmist says, <i>I beheld the transgressors and was grieved; because
they kept not thy word</i>, Psal. cxix. 158. But,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, When the Psalmist advises to <i>contemn</i> such an one,
the meaning is, that we should not make him our intimate, or
bosom-friend; or if he be in advanced circumstances, in the
world, we are not to flatter him in his sin; whereby, especially
when it is public, he forfeits that respect which would otherwise
be due to him. In this sense we are to understand
Mordecai’s contempt of Haman, Esther iii. 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we may take occasion to distinguish, between reproving
sin, and reproaching persons for it; the former of these is
to be done with sorrow of heart, and compassion expressed to
the sinner; as our Saviour reproved Jerusalem, and, at the
same time, <i>wept over it</i>, Luke xix. 41, 42. But, on the other
hand, reproach is attended with hatred of, and a secret pleasure
taken in his sin and ruin. Again, reproof for sin ought
to be with a design to reclaim the offender; whereas reproach
tends only to expose, exasperate, and harden him in his sin.
Moreover, reproof for sin ought to be given with the greatest
seriousness and conviction of the evil and danger ensuing
hereupon; whereas they who reproach persons, charge sin on
them, as being induced hereunto by their own passions, without
any concern for the dishonour which they bring to God
and religion hereby, or desire of their repentance and reformation.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] Sometimes that which is the highest ornament, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>greatest excellency of a Christian, is turned to his reproach;
more particularly,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, Some have been reproached for extraordinary gifts,
which God has been pleased to confer on them. Thus the
spirit of prophecy was sometimes reckoned, by profane persons,
the effect of distraction, 2 Kings ix. 11. And Joseph
was reproached by his brethren, in a taunting way, with the
character of a dreamer; because of the prophetic intimation
which he had from God, in a dream, concerning the future
estate of his family, Gen. xxxvii. 13. And when the apostles
were favoured with the extraordinary gift of tongues, and
preached to men of different nations, in their own language;
<i>Some were amazed, and others mocked them, and said, These
men are full of new wine</i>, Acts ii. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, Raised affections, and extraordinary instances of zeal
for the glory of God, have been derided as though they were
matter of reproach. Thus Michael reproached David, when
he <i>danced before the ark</i>, 2 Sam. vi. 20. being induced hereunto
by an holy zeal, and transport of joy on this occasion;
though he was so far from reckoning it a reproach, that he
counted that which she called vile, glorious.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Spiritual experiences of the grace of God, have, sometimes,
been turned by those who are strangers to them to their
reproach and termed no other than madness. Thus when the
apostle Paul related the gracious dealings of God with him in
his first conversion, Festus charged him with being <i>beside
himself</i>, Acts xxvi. 24.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, A person’s being made use of by God, to overthrow
the kingdom of Satan, has been charged against him, as though
it were rebellion. Thus the Jews tell Pilate, when he sought
to release Jesus, <i>If thou let this man go, thou art not Cesar’s
friend</i>, John xix. 12. and that reformation which the apostles
were instrumental in making in the world, by preaching the
gospel, is styled, <i>turning the world upside down</i>, Acts xvii. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>5thly</i>, Humility of mind in owning our weakness, as not being
able to comprehend some divine mysteries contained in
the gospel, is reckoned matter of reproach by many, who call
it implicit faith, and admitting of the greatest absurdities in
matters of religion.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>6thly</i>, Giving glory to the Spirit, as the author of all grace
and peace, and desiring to draw nigh to God in prayer, or engage
in other holy duties, by his assistance, is reproached by
some, as though it were enthusiasm, and they who desire or
are favoured with this privilege, were pretenders to extraordinary
revelation.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>7thly</i>, A being conscientious in abstaining from those sins
which abound in a licentious age, or reproving and bearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>our testimony against those who are guilty of them, is reproached
with the character of hypocrisy, preciseness, and
being righteous overmuch.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>8thly</i>, Separating from communion with a false church, and
renouncing those doctrines which tend to pervert the gospel
of Christ, is called, by some, heresy. Thus the Papists brand
the Protestants with the reproachful name of heretics; to
whom we may answer, that this is rather our glory, and confess,
that <i>after the way which they call heresy, so worship we
the God of our fathers</i>, Acts xxiv. 14.</p>

<p class='c006'>This sin is attended with many aggravations; for God
reckons it as a contempt cast on himself, Luke x. 16. and it
is a plain intimation, that they who are guilty of it, pretend not
to be what they reproach and deride in others, who, if they
be in the right way to heaven, these discover that they desire
not to come hither. And, in their whole conduct, they act as
though they were endeavouring to banish all religion out of the
world, by methods of scorn and ridicule; which, if it should
take effect, this earth would be but a small degree better than
hell.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, when we are thus reproached for the sake of God
and religion, let us not render railing for railing; but look on
those who revile us, as objects of pity, 1 Cor. iv. 12, 13. 1
Pet. ii. 23, who do more hurt to themselves than they can do
to us, thereby. Moreover, let us reflect on our own sins,
which provoke God to suffer this; and beg of him that he
would turn this reproach to his own glory, and our good.
Thus David did, when he was unjustly and barbarously cursed
and railed at by Shimei, 2 Sam. xvi. 10-12. We ought also
to esteem religion the more, because of the opposition and
contempt that it meets with from the enemies of God; which
may, indeed, afford us some evidence of the truth and excellency
thereof; as our Saviour says concerning his disciples, <i>If
ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because
you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of
the world, therefore the world hateth you</i>, John xv. 19.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, when we are reviled for the sake of Christ and religion,
let us take encouragement from hence, that herein we
have the same treatment that he, and all his saints, have met
with, Heb. xii. 2, 3. chap. xi. 36. And let us also consider
that there are many promises annexed hereunto, Matt. v. 11,
12. 1 Pet. iv. 14. It is also an advantage to our character
as Christians; for hereby it appears, that we are not on their
side, who are Christ’s avowed enemies; and therefore we
should reckon their reproach our glory, Heb. xi. 26, or, as the
apostle says, <i>Take pleasure in reproaches for Christ’s sake</i>, 2
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Cor. xii. 10. or, as it is said elsewhere, <i>Rejoice, that we are
counted worthy to suffer shame for his name</i>, Acts v. 41.
Thus concerning our doing injury to our neighbour, by speaking
against him before his face. We shall now consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The injury that is done to others by speaking against
them behind their backs. This they are guilty of, who raise
or invent false reports of their neighbours, or spread those
which ought to be kept secret, with a design to take away
their good name; these are called tale-bearers, back-biters,
slanderers, who offer injuries to others, that are not in a capacity
of defending themselves, Lev. xix. 16. These malicious
reports are oftentimes, indeed, prefaced, with a pretence of
great respect to the person whom they speak against. They
seem very much surprised at, and sorry for what they are going
to relate; and sometimes signify their hope, that it may
not be true; and desire, that what they report may be concealed,
while they make it their business themselves to divulge it.
But this method will not secure their own reputation, while
they are endeavouring to ruin that of another. This is done
various ways;</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) By pretending that a person is guilty of a fault which
he is innocent of. Thus our Saviour, and John the Baptist
were charged with immoral practices, which there was not the
least shadow or pretence for, Matt. xi. 18, 19.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) By divulging a real fault which has been acknowleged
and repented of, and therefore ought to be concealed, chap.
xvii. 15. or when there is no pretence for making it public;
but what arises from malice and hatred of the person.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) By aggravating, or presenting faults worse than they
are. Thus Absalom’s sin in murdering Amnon, was very
great; but he that brought tidings thereof to David, represented
it worse than it was, when he said, that Absalom had
<i>slain all the king’s sons</i>, 2 Sam. xiii. 30.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) By reporting the bad actions of men, and, at the same
time, over-looking and extenuating their good ones, and so
not doing them the justice of setting one in the balance against
the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) By putting the worst and most injurious construction
on actions that are really excellent. Thus, because our Saviour
admitted Publicans and sinners into his presence, and
did them good by his doctrine, the Jews reproached him as
though he were a <i>friend of publicans and sinners</i>, Matt. xi.
19. taking the word <i>friend</i> in the worst sense, as signifying an
approver of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) By reporting things, to the prejudice of others, which
are grounded on such slender evidence, that they themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>hardly believe them, or, at least, would not, had they not a
design to make use thereof, to defame them. Thus Sanballat,
in his letter to Nehemiah, tells him, that ‘he and the Jews
thought to rebel; and built the wall of Jerusalem, that he
might be their king,’ Neh. vi. 6. which, it can hardly be
supposed, that the enemy himself gave any credit to. Thus
concerning the instances in which persons back-bite, or raise
false reports on others.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, to this we may add, that as they are guilty who raise
them; so are they who listen to, and endeavour to propagate
them. It is not, indeed, the bare hearing of a report, which,
we cannot but think to be attended with malice and slander,
that will render us guilty; for that we may not be able to
avoid; but it is our encouraging him that raises or spreads it,
which renders us guilty; and, particularly, we sin when we
hear malicious reports.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] If we conceal them from the party concerned therein,
and so deny him the justice of answering what is said against
him, in his own vindication.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] When we do not reprove those who make a practice of
slandering and back-biting others, in order to our bringing
them to shame and repentance; and, most of all, when we
contract an intimacy with those who are guilty of this sin, and
are too easy in giving credit to what they say, though not supported
by sufficient evidence; but, on the other hand, carrying
in it the appearance of envy and resentment. Thus concerning
the sins forbidden in this Commandment. We shall close
this head by proposing some remedies against it. As,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, If the thing, reported to another’s prejudice, be true,
we ought to consider, that we are not without many faults
ourselves; which we would be unwilling, if others knew
them, should be divulged. And if it be doubtful, we, by reporting
it, may give occasion to some, to believe it to be
true, without sufficient evidence, whereby our neighbour will
receive real prejudice from that, which, to us, is only matter
of surmize and conjecture. But if, on the other hand, what
is reported be apparently false, the sin is still the greater; and
the highest injustice is hereby offered to the innocent, while
we, at the same time, are guilty of a known and presumptuous
sin, by inventing and propagating it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, Such a way of exposing men answers no good end;
nor is it a means of reclaiming them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Hereby we lay ourselves open to the censure of others,
and by endeavouring to take away our neighbour’s good name,
endanger the loss of our own.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CXLVI., CXLVII., CXLVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXLVI.</span> <i>Which is the tenth Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The tenth Commandment is, [<i>Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s
wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox,
nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s.</i>]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXLVII.</span> <i>What are the duties required in the tenth
Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The duties required in the tenth Commandment are,
such a full contentment with our own condition, and such a
charitable frame of the whole soul toward our neighbour,
as that all our inward motions and affections touching him
tend unto and further all that good which is his.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXLVIII.</span> <i>What are the sins forbidden in the tenth
Commandment?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sins forbidden in the tenth Commandment, are,
discontent with our own estate; envying, and grieving at
the good of our neighbours, together with all inordinate
motions and affections to any thing that is his.</p>

<p class='c011'>The general design of this commandment, is, to regulate
and set bounds to our desires; and it contains a prohibition
of coveting those things, that belong not to us. It is not
to be split into two Commandments, as the Papists pretend;
supposing that, <i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house</i>, is
the ninth, and, <i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife</i>, &amp;c.
is the tenth Commandment; since these are only particular
instances of the breach of the same Commandment, and the
argument taken from the repetition of the words, <i>Thou shalt
not covet</i>, is so very weak and inconclusive, that it would
hardly have been made use of by them, had they not thought
it necessary, some way or other, to make up the number ten;
having as was observed, under a foregoing head, determined
the second Commandment, not to be distinct from, but an appendix
to the first<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a>. But passing this by, we proceed to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. The duties required therein, which may be reduced to
two heads;</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Contentment with our own condition; by which we are
not to understand that we are to give way to indolence or stupidity,
but to exercise a composure of mind, acquiescing in
the divine dispensations in every condition of life. Thus the
apostle says, <i>I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>to be content</i>, Phil. iv. 11. And this being applicable to all sorts
of men, we may consider it,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) As a grace that is to be exercised by those who are in
prosperous circumstances in the world. Thus the apostle
says, <i>I know how to abound</i>, ver. 12. and to be <i>full</i>, as well as
to <i>suffer need</i>. We often find, that they who have the greatest
share of the good things of this world, are so far from being
satisfied with it, that their covetousness increaseth in proportion
to their substance. But such ought to consider, that this
is most unreasonable and ungrateful; and may justly provoke
God to take away the blessing which he has given them, or
add some circumstances thereunto, that will tend to embitter
them; and it is a giving way to such a temper of mind as renders
them really miserable in the midst of their abundance.
But that which we shall principally consider, is,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) How this grace of contentment is to be exercised by
those who are in an afflicted state, together with the motives
and inducements leading thereunto. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] We will suppose persons under bodily weakness or
pain, which tends much to embitter the comforts of life, by
which means they are made uneasy; and, indeed, it is impossible,
from the nature of the thing, for them not to complain,
or groan under the burdens that are laid on them, as the
Psalmist did, who speaks of himself as <i>weary of his groaning</i>,
Psal. vi. 6. nor is it unlawful, provided they do not repine at,
or find fault with, the methods of God’s providence, in his
dealing with them. Nevertheless there are some things that
may induce them to be contented.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, When they consider, that the body gave occasion to the
first entrance of sin into the world, and bears a part with the
soul in all the sins committed, and guilt contracted thereby.
It is therefore no wonder, when we find that it has its share
in those miseries that attend it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, Bodily diseases are our monitors, to put us in mind
of the frailty of our present state; and therefore, since they
are the harbingers of death, we are hereby forwarned, to prepare
for it, as making sensible advances towards it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, The greatest pains that we are liable to, are far short
of what Christ endured for us; in which respect our afflictions
are comparatively light, and a convincing proof, that they are
not certain indications of our being rejected by God, Eccl.
ix. 1.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, As God will not lay more on us than he will enable
us to bear; so none of these afflictive dispensations shall have
a tendency to separate the soul from Christ. Though we
sometimes complain that this is a great interruption to the
exercise of grace; yet this shall not be charged upon us as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>our fault, any otherwise than as it is the effect of that sin,
which is the procuring cause of all affliction.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>5thly</i>, The heavier our afflictions are at present, the more
sweet and comfortable the heavenly rest will be, to those who
have a well-grounded hope that they shall be brought to it,
Job iii. 17. 2 Thess. i. 7. 2 Cor. iv. 17.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] If our condition be low and poor in the world, we are
not without some inducements to be content. For,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, Poverty is not, in itself, a curse, or inconsistent with
the love of God, since Christ himself submitted to it, 2 Cor.
viii. 9. Matt. viii. 20. and his best saints have been exposed
to it, and glorified God, more than others, under it, 2 Cor.
vi. 10.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, How poor soever we are, we have more than we
brought into the world with us, or than the richest person can
carry out of it, Job i. 21.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, They who have least of the world, have more than
they deserve, or than God was under any obligation to give
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] Suppose we are afflicted in our good name, and do not
meet with that love and esteem from the world, which might be
expected; but, on the other hand, are censured, reproached,
and hated by those with whom we converse. This should
not make us, beyond measure, uneasy. For,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, We have reason to conclude, that the esteem of the
world is precarious and uncertain; and they who most deserve
it, have oftentimes the least of it. Thus our Saviour was one
day followed with the caresses of the multitude, shouting forth
their hosannah’s to him; and the next day the common cry
was, crucify him, crucify him. And when the apostle Paul
and Barnabas, had healed the cripple at Lystra, they could,
at first, hardly restrain the people from offering sacrifice to
them; but afterwards they joined with the malicious Jews in
stoning them, Acts xiv. 18, 19. And Paul tells the Galatians,
that ‘if it had been possible, they would have plucked
out their eyes, and have given them to him;’ but a little after
this, he complains that he was ‘become their enemy, because
he told them the truth,’ Gal. iv. 15, 16.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, The esteem of men is no farther to be desired, than
as it may render us useful to them; and if God is pleased to
deny this to us, we are not to prescribe to him, what measure
of respect he shall allot to us from the world, or usefulness
in it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Let us consider, that we know more evil abounding
in our own hearts than others can charge us with. Therefore,
how much soever they are guilty of injustice to us; yet this
affords us a motive to contentment. Besides we have not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>brought that honour to God that we ought; therefore, how
just is it for him to deny us that esteem from men which we
desire?</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] Suppose we are afflicted in our relations; there are
some motives to contentment. Thus if servants have masters
who make their lives uncomfortable, by their unreasonable
demands, or unjust severity, such ought to consider, that their
faithfulness and industry will be approved of, by God, how
much soever it may be disregarded, by men; and a conscientious
discharge of the duties incumbent on them, in the relation
in which they stand, will give them ground to expect a
blessing from God, to whom they are herein said to do service,
which shall not go unrewarded, Eph. vi. 7, 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other hand, if masters are afflicted, by reason of the
stubborn and unfaithful behaviour, or sloth and negligence, of
their servants; let them enquire, whether this be not the consequence
of their not being so much concerned for their spiritual
welfare as they ought, or keeping up strict religion in
their families? or, whether they have not been more concerned
that their servants should obey them, than their great master,
which is in heaven?</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, if parents have undutiful children, which are a grief
of heart to them; let them consider, as a motive to contentment,
whether they have not formerly neglected their duty to
their parents, slighted their counsels, or disregarded their reproofs?
so whether they have not reason to charge themselves
with the iniquity of their youth? and enquire, whether God
be not, herein, writing bitter things against them for it? or,
whether they have not neglected to bring up their children in
the nurture and admonition of the Lord? These considerations
will fence against all repining thoughts at the providence
of God, that has brought these troubles upon them. And, as
a farther inducement to make them easy, let such consider,
that if this does not altogether lie at their door, but, they have
been faithful to their children, in praying for, and instructing
them, God may hear their prayers, and set home their instructions
on their hearts, when they themselves are removed
out of the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other hand, if children have wicked parents, whose
conversation fills them with great uneasiness; let such consider,
that this has been the case of many of God’s faithful servants;
such as Hezekiah, Josiah, and others; and they may
be assured, that they shall have no occasion to use that proverb,
‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s
teeth are set on edge,’ Ezek. xviii. 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] If we are afflicted, by reason of the treachery and unfaithfulness
of pretended friends, which wound us in the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>tender part, Psal. lv. 12, 13. we may be induced to be content.
For,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, We have no ground to expect perfection in the best of
men, nor that their love and favour is immutable; neither is
our conduct always such, that we do not often forfeit the respect,
which we once had from others.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, If our friends deal deceitfully with us, or are unfaithful
to us, without just ground; this is not without the permission
of the wise and over-ruling providence of God, who,
sometimes, orders it to take us off from a dependence upon
men, or expecting too much happiness from them; which is
to be sought for only in himself, Isa. ii. 22.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, This is our encouragement, when we find a change in
the behaviour of friends towards us, that our chief happiness
consists in the unchangeable love of God, Mal. iii. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>[6.] When we are afflicted in the loss of friends, or near relations;
let us consider, as a motive to contentment,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That there is no reversing or altering the decree of
God, which fixes the bounds of men’s continuance in this
world, Job xiv. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, All the comfort we have in friends and relations is a
peculiar blessing from God; and he sometimes afflicts us in
the loss of them, that he may draw off our affections from the
best creature-enjoyments, and we may take up our rest intirely
in himself. Moreover, we had never any reason to look on
our friends as immortal, any more than ourselves; and therefore
ought to say as David did when he lost his child, <i>I shall
go to him, but he shall not return to me</i>, 2 Sam. xii. 23. and so
far as self-love is concerned herein, we have reason to give a
check to the excess thereof, by the exercise of self-denial, and
say with David, <i>I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, because
thou didst it</i>, Psal. xxxix. 8. or follow the example of
Aaron, concerning whom it is said, that, when he lost two of
his sons at once, by a public and awful stroke of divine justice,
<i>he held his peace</i>, Lev. x. 3.</p>

<p class='c006'>[7.] If we are afflicted by the want of success, or the many
disappointments that attend us, in our lawful callings, in the
world, we have reason, notwithstanding, to be content, if we
consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That it is the sovereign hand of God that orders our
condition therein, as to what respects the success or disappointments
that attend it; therefore we are not to strive against
our Maker, or find fault with his will, who may do what he
pleases with his own.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, A man’s happiness does not really consist in the abundance
of what he possesses, Luke xii. 15. but rather in his
having a heart to use it aright; therefore we ought to say to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>ourselves, as God did to Baruch, <i>Seekest thou great things
for thyself? seek them not</i>, Jer. xlv. 5.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, The world is a scene of vanity; we have no reason to
expect too much from it; and therefore ought not to be dejected
at the loss of it; especially considering that such disappointments
are the common lot of all sorts of men.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, The providence of God sometimes denies us the good
things of this world, that we may think it our duty and interest
to lay up treasures in heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>[8.] Suppose we meet with afflictions, as to what relates to
our spiritual concerns, as being under divine desertion, or
decays of grace, or want of a sense of the love of God, or
those spiritual comforts, which we once enjoyed from him; in
this condition no believer can or ought to be easy, at least,
stupid and unconcerned about it; but, on the other hand, he
ought to be humbled for those sins which may give occasion
to it, and press after the enjoyment of what he is, at present,
deprived of: Nevertheless, contentment, as it is opposed
to repining or quarrelling with God, is his present duty;
and there are some inducements tending thereunto; as,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, A person may have the truth of grace, when he is destitute
of the comfortable sense thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, There are some great and precious promises made to
believers, in this condition, Isa. liv. 7, 8. Psal. cxii. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, God has wise ends in this dispensation; for hereby
he brings sin to remembrance, humbles us for it, fences against
presumption and confidence in our own strength, Psal. xxx.
6, 7. He also puts us upon the exercise of suitable graces,
Psal. xlii. 6. and lxxvii. 6. and when he is pleased to comfort
us after such afflictions, we are better furnished to comfort
others in the like case.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The next thing required in this Commandment, is, a
charitable frame of spirit towards our neighbour; so that all
our inward motions and affections should lead us to promote
and rejoice in his good, 1 Cor. xiii. 4-7. This charitable
frame of spirit ought to be exercised,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Towards those who excel us in gifts or graces: These
they receive from the hand of providence, as talents to be
improved; and therefore, if they have a greater share thereof
than ourselves, more is required of them in proportion
thereunto, Luke xii. 48. If they excel us in grace, we ought
rather to rejoice, that though we bring but little glory to
God, others bring more; and it will afford us an evidence
of the truth of grace, if, while we are humbled under a
sense of our own defects, we are thankful for the honour
that is brought to God by others, Gal. i. 23, 24. John iii.
26, 27, 28, 30.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>(2.) We ought to exercise a charitable frame of spirit towards
those who are in more prosperous circumstances in the
world; not envying, grieving, or repining at the providence of
God, because their condition therein is better than ours. We
are therefore to consider, that the most flourishing and
prosperous condition in the world, is not always the best,
Psal. xxxvii. 16. nor is it without many temptations that often
attend it, 1 Tim. vi. 9. and if it be not improved to the
glory of God, this will bring a greater weight of guilt on their
consciences: Whereas, on the other hand, if we enjoy communion
with him, and the blessings of the upper springs, this
is much more desirable than the most prosperous condition
in the world, without it, Psal. xvi. 5, 6. This leads us to
consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. The sins forbidden in this Commandment. And these
include in them, that corrupt fountain from whence the irregularity
of our desires proceeds; or the streams that flow
from it, which discover themselves in the lusts of concupiscence
in various instances, as well as in our being discontented with
our own estate.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As to the former of these, to wit, the corruption of nature;
this must be considered as contrary to the law of God,
and consequently forbidden in this Commandment. The Pelagians
and Papists, indeed, pretend that the law of God only
respects the corruption of our actions which is to be checked
and restrained thereby; and not the internal habits or principle
from whence they proceed; accordingly they take an
estimate hereof from human laws, which only respect the overt
acts of sin, and not those internal inclinations and dispositions
which persons have to commit it: But when we speak
of the divine laws, we must not take our plan from thence;
for though man can only judge of outward actions, God
judgeth the heart; and therefore that sin which reigns there,
cannot but be, in the highest degree, offensive to him; and
though the corruption of our nature cannot be altogether prevented
or extirpated, by any prescription in the divine law;
yet, this is the means which God takes, to reprove and humble
us for it, Rom. vii. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> It is objected that the apostle James, in chap. i.
15. distinguishes between lust and sin; <i>when lust hath conceived
it bringeth forth sin</i>; therefore the corruption of nature
is not properly sin; and, consequently not forbidden by the
law.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied; that lust may be distinguished
from sin, as the habit or corrupt principle is from the
act which it produces; and therefore, the apostle’s meaning in
this scripture is, that lust, or irregular desires, are first conceived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>in the heart; and then actual sins proceed from them in the
life; and both of them are abhorred by God, and contrary to
his law: And they seem to be forbidden, in particular, in this
tenth Commandment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we may observe the various methods that corrupt nature
takes, in order to its producing and bringing forth sinful
actions. First, the temptation is offered, either by Satan, or
the world, with a specious pretence of some advantage which
may arise from our compliance with it; and, at the same time
we consider not whether it be lawful or unlawful; and regard
not the threatnings that should deter us from it. And, we sometimes
take occasion, from the pernicious examples of the falls
and miscarriages of others, to venture on the commission of
the same sins; pretending that they are, many of them, more
acquainted with scripture, than we are; and there seems
to be no ill consequence attending their commission of those
sins: therefore, why may we not give way to them? And
also, that many, who have had more fortitude and resolution
than we can pretend to, have been overcome by the
same temptations; therefore it is in vain for us to strive
against them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, corrupt nature sometimes fills the soul with a secret
dislike of the strictness and purity of the law of God; and, at
other times, it suggests that there are some dispensations allowed,
in compliance with the frailty of nature; and therefore,
we may venture on the commission of some sins; At length
we take up a resolution that we will try the experiment, whatever
be the consequence thereof. Thus lust brings forth sin;
which, after it has been, for some time indulged, is committed
with greediness, and persisted in with resolution; and, in the
end, brings forth death. And this leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The irregularity of those actions, which proceed from
the corruption of our nature, which are sometimes, called the
lusts of concupiscence; whereby, without the least shew of
justice, we endeavour to possess ourselves of those things
which belong to our neighbour. Thus Ahab was restless in
his own spirit, till he had got Naboth’s vineyard into his
hand; and, in order thereto, joined in a conspiracy, to take
away his life, 1 Kings xxi. 4. And David coveted his neighbour’s
wife; which was one of the greatest blemishes in his
life, and brought with it a long train of miseries, that attended
him in the following part of his reign, 2 Sam. xii. 9-12. And
Achan coveted those goods which belonged not to him, the
<i>wedge of gold</i>, and the <i>Babylonish garment</i>, Josh. vii. 21.
which sin proved his ruin.</p>

<p class='c006'>This sin of covetousness arises from a being discontented
with our present condition, so that whatever measure of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>blessings of providence we enjoy, we are notwithstanding,
filled with disquietude of mind, because we are destitute of
what we are lusting after. This must be considered as a sin
that is attended with very great aggravations. For,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) It unfits us for the performance of holy duties; prevents
the exercise of those graces, which are necessary in order
thereunto; and, on the other hand, exposes us to manifold
temptations, whereby we are rendered an easy prey to
our spiritual enemies.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) It is altogether unlike the temper of the blessed Jesus,
who expressed an entire resignation to the divine will, under
the greatest sufferings, John xviii. 11. Luke xxi. 42. And, indeed,
it is a very great reproach to religion, in general, and a
discouragement to those who are setting their faces towards it,
who will be ready to conclude, from our example, that the
consolations of God are small, or that there is not enough in
the promises of the covenant of grace, to quiet our spirits under
their present uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) It is to act as though we expected, or desired our portion
in this world, or looked no farther than these present
things; which is contrary to the practice of the best of God’s
saints, 2 Cor. iv. 18.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) It tends to cast the utmost contempt on the many mercies
we have received or enjoy, at present, which are, as it
were, forgotten in unthankfulness; and it is a setting aside
those blessings which the gospel gives us to expect.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) It argues an unwillingness to be at God’s disposal, and
a leaning to our own understandings, as though we knew better
than him, what was most conducive to our present and future
happiness; and therefore, it is a tempting God, and
grieving his Holy Spirit, which has a tendency to provoke him
to <i>turn to be our enemy</i>, and <i>fight against us</i>, Isa. lxiii. 10.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) It deprives us of the present sweetness of other mercies;
renders every providence, in our apprehension, afflictive;
and those burdens which would otherwise be light, almost insupportable.</p>

<p class='c006'>(7.) If God is pleased to give us what we were discontented
and uneasy for the want of, he often sends some great affliction
with it: Thus Rachel, in a discontented frame, says,
<i>Give me children, or else I die</i>, Gen. xxx. 1. she had, indeed,
in some respects, her desire of children; but died in travail
with one of them, chap. xxxv. 19.</p>

<p class='c006'>(8.) It is a sin, which they, who are guilty of, will find it
very difficult to be brought to a thorough conviction of the
guilt which they contract hereby, or a true repentance for it:
Thus Jonah, when under a discontented and uneasy frame of
spirit, justified himself, and, as it were, defied God to do his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>worst against him; so that when this matter was charged upon
his conscience; <i>Dost thou well to be angry?</i> he replied, in
a very insolent manner, <i>I do well to be angry, even unto death</i>,
Jonah iv. 9. The justifying ourselves under such a frame of
spirit, cannot but be highly provoking to God; and whatever
we may be prone to allege in our own behalf, will rather
aggravate, than extenuate the crime.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are several things which a discontented person is
apt to allege in his own vindication, which have a tendency
only to enhance his guilt. As,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] When he pretends that his natural temper leads him
to be uneasy, so that he cannot, by any means, subdue his
passions, or submit to the disposing providence of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>To which it may be replied; that the corruption of our
nature, and its proneness to sin, is no just excuse for, but rather
an aggravation of it; whereby it appears to be more
deeply rooted in our hearts; and, indeed, our natural inclinations
to any sin are increased, by indulging it. Therefore,
in this case, we ought rather to be importunate with God, for
that grace which may have a tendency to restrain the inordinacy
of our affections, and render us willing to acquiesce in
the divine dispensations, than to paliate and excuse our sin;
which only aggravates the guilt thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Some, in excuse for their discontented and uneasy frame
of spirit, allege; that the injuries which have been offered to
them, ought to be resented, that they are such as they are
not able to bear; and not to show themselves uneasy under
them, would be to encourage persons to insult and trample on
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to this it may be replied; that while we complain of injuries
done us by men, and are prone to meditate revenge
against them, we do not consider the great dishonour that we
bring to God, and how much we deserve to be made the monuments
of his fury, so that we should not obtain forgiveness
from him, who are so prone to resent lesser injuries done to us
by our fellow-creatures, Matt. xviii. 23. <i>&amp; seq.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] Others excuse their discontent, by alleging the greatness
of their afflictions; that their burden is almost insupportable,
so that they are pressed out of measure, above strength,
and are ready to say with Job, <i>Even to day is my complaint
bitter; my stroke is heavier than my groaning</i>, Job xxiii. 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to this it may be replied; that our afflictions are not so
great as our sins, which are the procuring cause thereof; nor
are they greater than some that befal others, who are better
than ourselves; and, indeed, by indulging a discontented frame
of spirit, we render them heavier than they would otherwise
be.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>[4.] Some pretend, that they are discontented and uneasy
because the affliction they are under, was altogether unexpected;
and therefore they were unprovided for, and so less able
to bear it. To this it may be replied;</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That a Christian ought daily to expect afflictions in this
miserable and sinful world, at least, so far as not to be unprovided
for, or think it strange that he should be exercised with
them, 1 Pet. iv. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, We have received many unlooked for mercies; and
therefore, why should we be uneasy because we meet with
unexpected afflictions, and not rather set the one against the
other.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, Some of God’s best children have oftentimes been
surprized with afflictive providences, and yet have been enabled
to exercise contentment under them. Thus the messengers
who brought Job heavy and unexpected tidings of one
affliction immediately following another, Job i. 13, &amp; <i>seq.</i> did
not overthrow his faith, or make him discontented under the
hand of God; for, notwithstanding all this, he <i>worshipped</i> and
<i>blessed the name of the Lord</i>, ver. 20, 21.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] Others allege, that the change which is made in their
circumstances in the world, from a prosperous to an afflicted
condition of life, is so great, and lies with such weight upon
their spirits, that it is impossible for them to be easy under it.
But to this it may be answered,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That when God gave us the good things we are deprived
of, he reserved to himself the liberty of taking them
away when he pleased, as designing hereby, to shew his absolute
sovereignty over us; and therefore, before this affliction
befel us, it was our duty, according to the apostle’s advice, to
<i>rejoice as though we rejoiced not</i>, and to <i>use the world as not
abusing it</i>, 1 Cor. vii. 30. and not to think it strange, that we
should be deprived of it, inasmuch as <i>the fashion</i> thereof
<i>passeth away</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, The greater variety of conditions in which we have
been, or are, in the world, afford more abundant experience
of those dealings of God with us, which are designed as an
ordinance for our faith; and therefore, instead of being discontented
under them, we ought rather to be put hereupon, on
the exercise of those graces that are suitable to the change of
our condition, as the apostle says, <i>I know both how to be abased,
and I know how to abound</i>, Phil. iv. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>[6.] Some allege, that they have the greatest reason to be
discontented, because of the influence which their afflictions
have on their spiritual concerns, as they tend to interrupt their
communion with God; and they are often ready to fear, that
these are indications of his wrath, and, as it were, the beginning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of sorrows; which leads them to the very brink of despair.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this it may be replied; that it is certain nothing more
sharpens the edge of afflictions, or has a greater tendency to
make us uneasy under them, than such thoughts as these; and
not to be sensible hereof, would be an instance of the greatest
stupidity; yet let us consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That if our fears are ill-grounded, as they sometimes
are, the uneasiness that arises from them is unwarrantable.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, If we have too much ground for them, we are to make
use of the remedy that God has provided; accordingly we are
to have recourse by faith, to the blood of Jesus, for forgiveness;
and this ought to be accompanied with the exercise of
true repentance, and godly sorrow for sin, without giving way
to those despairing apprehensions, that sometimes arise from
a sense of the greatness of the guilt thereof, as though it set
us out of the reach of mercy; which will add an insupportable
weight to our burden; and,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, If under the afflicting hand of God, we are rendered
unfit for holy duties, and have no communion with him therein;
this may be owing, not to the affliction, but that discontented,
uneasy frame of spirit which we too much indulge under
it. Therefore we are not to allege this as an excuse for
that murmuring, repining frame of spirit which we are too apt
to discover while exercised therewith.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last thing to be considered is, the remedies against this
sin of being discontented with our present condition; and these
are,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, A due sense of that undoubted right which God has to
dispose of us, and our condition in this world, as he pleases;
inasmuch as we are his own, Matt. xx. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, Uneasiness under the hand of God, or repining at his
dealings, when he thinks fit to deprive us of the blessings we
once enjoyed, is not the way to recover the possession of them;
but the best expedient for us to regain them, or some other
blessings that are more than an equivalent for them, is our exercising
an entire resignation to the will of God, and concluding
that all his dispensations are holy, just, and good.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Let us consider, that God oftentimes designs to make
us better by the sharpest trials, which are an ordinance to
bring us nearer to himself. Thus David says, <i>Before I was
afflicted, I went astray; but now have I kept thy word</i>, Psal.
cxix. 67.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, We ought to consider that God’s design in these dispensations
is, to <i>try our faith</i>, and that it <i>may found afterwards
unto praise, honour, and glory</i>, as it will be, with respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>to every true believer, <i>at the appearing of Jesus Christ</i>,
1 Pet. i. 7. And to this we may add,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>5thly</i>, That there are many promises of the presence of God,
which have not only a tendency to afford relief against uneasiness
or dejection of spirit; but to give us the greatest encouragement
under the sorest afflictions; particularly, that
comprehensive promise, <i>I will never leave thee, nor forsake
thee</i>, Heb. xiii. 5.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CXLIX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXLIX.</span> <i>Is any man able perfectly to keep the Commandments
of God?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> No man is able, either in himself, or by any grace received
in this life, perfectly to keep the Commandments of
God, but doth daily break them in thought, word, and deed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having considered man’s duty and obligation to keep
the Commandments of God; we are now led to speak of
him as unable to keep them; and, on the other hand, chargeable
with the daily breach thereof, which is an argument of
the imperfection of this present state. We have, under a
foregoing answer<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a>, endeavoured to prove that the work of
sanctification is imperfect in this life; so that all the boasts of
the Pelagians, and others, who defend the possibility of attaining
perfection therein, are vain and unwarrantable. We have
also considered the reasons why God orders that it should be
so. And therefore we shall, without enlarging so much on
this subject, as otherwise we might have done, principally take
notice of what is to be observed in this answer, under two
general heads.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. In what respects, and with what limitations, man is said
to be unable to keep the Commandments of God; and, accordingly
it is said, that no man is able, perfectly, to keep them.
By which we are to understand, as it is observed in the Shorter
Catechism<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a>, no mere man, whereby our Saviour is excepted,
who yielded perfect obedience in our nature. This
is farther explained, with another limitation, namely, that no
man is able to do this since the fall; to denote that man, in
his state of innocency, was able, perfectly to keep the Commandments
of God. For he was made upright, and had the
image of God instamped on his soul; which consisted in
knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, Eccl. vii. 29. Gen. i.
27. having the law of God written in his heart, and power to
fulfil it<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a>. And, indeed, to suppose the contrary, would be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>reflection upon the divine government, and would argue man
to have been created under a natural necessity of sinning, and
perishing; which is contrary to the goodness, holiness, and
justice of God. It is farther observed, that no man is able,
in this life, thus to keep God’s Commandments, which contains
an intimation that the glorified saints, in heaven, will be
enabled to yield perfect obedience; notwithstanding the many
imperfections they are now liable to. Moreover, as man is
not able, of himself, or without the aids of divine grace, to
obey God; so he is not to expect such assistance from him as
shall enable him to obey him perfectly. There is no doubt
but the grace of God could free us from all the remainders of
sin in this world, as well as in our passing from it to heaven;
but we have no ground to conclude that it will. For,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>The whole creation</i> is liable to the curse,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> (which was
consequent upon man’s first apostasy from God,) under which
it <i>groaneth</i>, unto this day, Rom. viii. 22, 23. and shall not be
delivered from it, till the scene of time, and things shall be
changed, and the saints shall be fully possessed of what they
are now waiting for, to wit, the <i>adoption</i>, or <i>the redemption of
their bodies</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. God is pleased to deny his people that perfection of holiness
here, which they shall attain to hereafter, that he may
give them daily occasion to exercise the duties of self-denial,
mortification of sin, faith, and repentance, which redound to
his own glory, and their spiritual advantage. This leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. To consider that we daily break the Commandments of
God, in thought, word, and deed.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. In thought; to wit, when the mind is conversant about
sinful objects, in such away, as that it contracts defilement. It
is a sign that the wickedness of man is very great, when,
<i>every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil</i>, and
that <i>continually</i>, Gen. vi. 5. Now the sinfulness of the
thoughts of men, consists in four things;</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) When they chuse, delight in, and are daily conversant
about things that are vain, empty of what is good, and have
no tendency to the glory of God, or the spiritual advantage
either of ourselves or others. The least vain thought which
contains an excursion from our duty to God, brings some degree
of guilt with it; but when the mind is wholly taken up
with vanity, so that it is turned aside from, or takes no delight
in those things that are of the highest importance, this
will have a tendency to vitiate the mind, and alienate it from
the life of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The thoughts of men may be said to be sinful, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>they are not fixed, or intensely set, on God and divine things,
when engaged in holy duties; and that either, when worldly
cares or business, how lawful soever they may be at other
times, have a tendency to divert our thoughts from them, being
altogether inconsistent therewith. Or when our minds
are conversant about spiritual things unseasonably, so as to be
diverted from our present design; as, when we are joining
with others in prayer, instead of bearing a part with them,
in having the same exercise of faith, and other graces, which
supposes that our thoughts are employed about the same object
with theirs, we are meditating on some other divine subject,
foreign to the present occasion.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Our thoughts may be said to be sinful, when they are
conversant about spiritual things, without suitable affections,
and, consequently, meditating on them as common things, in
which we are not much concerned; as when we are destitute
of those holy desires after, or delight in God, when drawing
nigh to him in holy duties, which his law requires. And
this will more evidently appear, when, by comparing the frame
of our spirit therein, with what we observe it to be in other
instances, we find, that our affections are easily raised, when
engaged in matters of less importance, but stupid, and unconcerned
about our eternal welfare, in holy duties; which is accompanied
with hardness of heart and impenitency, and sometimes
with uneasiness and weariness, as though they were a
burden to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other hand, our affections may be raised in these
duties, and yet we be chargeable with a sinfulness of thought
therein; as,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] When the affections are raised by things of less importance,
while other things that are more affecting, are not
regarded. As, supposing a person is meditating on Christ’s
sufferings, and he is very much affected with, and enraged at
the treachery of Judas, that betrayed him, or the barbarity of
the Jews, that crucified him; but not in the least with the sin
of the world, that was the occasion of it, or the greatness of
his love, that moved him to submit to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] When our affections are raised in holy duties, and this
is all that we depend upon, for justification and acceptance in
the sight of God, vainly supposing that our tears will wash
away our sins, being destitute of faith in the blood of Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] When we are concerned about the misery consequent
on our sins, but are not in the least inclined to hate them, nor
grieved at the dishonour brought to the name of God thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>This leads us to consider the causes hereof, and remedies
against it. If we do not find that our affections are raised in
these religious exercises, as they have been in times past, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>ought to enquire into the reason thereof; whether this be not
attended with some great backslidings from God, which might
first occasion it. Sometimes it proceeds from a neglect of
holy duties, either public or private; at other times, from presumptuous
sins, committed, or continued in, with impenitency.
And we often find, that our being too much embarrassed with,
or immoderately engaged in our pursuit of the profits or pleasures
of this world, stupifies and damps our affections, as to
religious matters, so that they are seldom or never raised
therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the remedies against this stupid and unaffected frame
of spirit; we must not only repent of, but abstain from those
sins, that have been the occasion thereof; meditate on those
subjects, that are most suitable to our case, which have a tendency
to enflame our love to Christ, and desire after him, and
our zeal for his glory; and often confess and bewail our stupidity
and unbecoming behaviour in holy duties; earnestly
imploring the powerful influence of the Spirit of God, to bring
us into, and keep us in a right frame of spirit for them.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) We have reason to charge ourselves with sin, when
guilty of blasphemous thoughts; as,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, When we have, by degrees, brought on ourselves a disregard
of God, either by living in the neglect of holy duties,
or allowing ourselves in the practice of known sins.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, When, before we were followed with these thoughts,
we have found that we gave way to some doubts about the
divine perfections; or, through the ignorance, pride and vanity
of our minds, have contracted an habitual disregard to, or
neglect of that holy reverence with which we ought to meditate
on them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, When we can hear those execrable oaths or curses, by
which some profanely blaspheme the name of God, without expressing
our resentment with the utmost abhorrence and detestation.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, When we find, that being followed with blasphemous
thoughts, our hearts are too prone to give in to them, as though
they were the sentiments of our mind; whereby we do, as it
were, consent to them, instead of rejecting them with the utmost
aversion.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, on the other hand, blasphemous thoughts are not always
to be charged on us as a sin. Sometimes they are chargeable
on Satan, who herein acts according to his character, as God’s
open enemy; and endeavours to instil into us the same ideas
that he himself has. These thoughts may be charged on him;
when they are hastily injected into our minds, not being the
result of choice or deliberation; but are a kind of violence offered
to our imagination, and, we cannot but discover the greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>detestation of them, as well as of that enemy of souls, from
whom they take their rise; and when, at the same time, we
are enabled to exercise the contrary graces, and betake ourselves
to God with faith and prayer, that he would rebuke the
Devil, and preserve our consciences undefiled, under this sore
temptation, which we cannot but reckon one of the greatest afflictions
that befal us in the world. Thus concerning the sinfulness
of our thoughts.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are farther said, daily to break the Commandments
of God in word. Thus the apostle James speaks of the <i>tongue</i>
as <i>an unruly evil full of deadly poison</i>, James iii. 8. Evil-speaking,
as was before observed concerning the sinfulness of our
thoughts, is attended with a greater or less degree of guilt, as
the vanity of the mind, and the wickedness of the heart, more
or less discovers itself therein. Our Saviour speaks of the accountableness
of man in the day of judgment, for every <i>idle
word</i>, Matt. xii. 36. to denote, that there is no sin so small,
but what is displeasing to an holy God, a violation of his law,
and brings with it a degree of guilt, in proportion to the nature
thereof. These indeed, are the lowest instances of the
sinfulness of words. There are others that are of so heinous a
nature, that they can hardly be reckoned consistent with true
godliness. <i>viz.</i> defaming, and malicious words; which are
sometimes compared to a <i>sword</i>, or <i>arrows</i>, Psal. lvii. 4. or to
a <i>serpent’s tongue</i>, that leaves a sting and poison behind it, Psal.
cxl. 3. Again, the sinfulness of our words extends itself yet
farther, as they are directed against the blessed God; when
persons <i>set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue
walketh through the earth</i>, Psal. lxxiii. 9. when they give themselves
the liberty to talk profanely about sacred things, and
openly blaspheme the name and perfections of God. This degree
of impiety, indeed, all are not chargeable with. Nevertheless,
we may say, should God mark the iniquity of our
words, as well as of our thoughts, who could stand?</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We are said to break the Commandments of God, by
deeds, <i>i. e.</i> by committing those sins which are contrived in
the heart, and uttered with our tongues. These have been
considered under their respective heads, as a violation of each
of the ten Commandments, or doing those things that are forbidden
therein; and therefore we pass them over in this place,
and proceed to speak concerning the aggravations of sin.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> All transgressions of the law of God are not equally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>heinous. But some sins in themselves, and by reason of
several aggravations, are more heinous in the sight of God
than others.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though all sins be objectively infinite, and equally opposite
to the holiness of God; yet there are some circumstances
attending them, which are of that pernicious tendency,
that they render one sin more heinous than another; so
that it is not to be thought of, without the greatest horror and
resentment; as well as expose the sinner to a sorer condemnation,
if it be not forgiven. These are such as strike at the
very essentials of religion, and tend, as much as in us lies, to
sap the foundation thereof; as when men deny the being and
perfections of God, and practically disown their obligation, to
yield obedience to him. And some sins against the second table,
which more immediately respect our neighbour, are more
heinous than others, in proportion to the degree of injury done
him thereby. Thus the taking away the life of another, is
more injurious, and consequently more aggravated than barely
the hating of him; which is, nevertheless, a very great crime.
Moreover, the same sin, whether against the Commandments
of the first or second table, may be said to be more or less
heinous, in proportion to the degree of obstinacy, deliberation,
malice, or enmity against God, with which it is committed;
but these things will more evidently appear under the following
answer; which we proceed to consider,</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='quest-151' class='c004'>Quest. CLI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLI.</span> <i>What are those aggravations which make some
sins more heinous than others?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Sins receive their aggravations,</p>

<p class='c007'>I. From the persons offending, if they be of riper age, greater
experience, or grace, eminent for profession, gifts, place,
office; guides to others, and whose example is likely to be
followed by others.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sins are greater than otherwise they would be when committed
by those whose age and experience ought to have
taught them better. Thus Elihu says, <i>A multitude of years
should teach wisdom</i>, Job xxxii. 7. Many things would be a
reproach to such persons, which are more agreeable to the character
of children, than those who are advanced in age. Again,
if they have had large experience of the grace of God, and
been eminent for their profession, or gifts conferred on them.
These circumstances will render the same sin more aggravated;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>for where much is given, an improvement is expected in
proportion thereunto; and where great pretensions are made
to religion, the acting disagreeable thereunto, enhances the
guilt, and renders the sin more heinous. Again, if the person
offending be in an eminent station, or office in the world, or the
church; so that he is either a guide to others, or the eyes of
many are upon him, who will be apt to follow and receive prejudice
by his example. When such an one commits a public
and open sin, it is more aggravated than if it had been committed
by another. Thus God bids the prophet Ezekiel <i>see
what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every
man in the chambers of his imagery</i>, Ezek. viii. 12. And the
prophet Jeremiah speaks of those who ought to have been
guides to the people, <i>viz.</i> the priests and the prophets, Jer.
xxiii. 11. 14. who transgressed against the Lord; and charges
this on them as an extraordinary instance of wickedness; which
their character in the world, and the church rendered more
heinous, though it was exceeding heinous in itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>II. Sins receive their aggravations, from the parties offended;
if immediately against God, his attributes, and worship, against
Christ, and his grace; the holy Spirit, his witness,
and workings, against superiors, men of eminency, and such
as we stand especially related and engaged unto; against
any of the saints, particularly weak brethren, the souls of
them, or any other, and the common good of all or many.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is no sin but what may be said to be committed against
God; yet,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Some are more immediately against him, as they carry in
them a contempt of his attributes and worship; whereby his
name and ordinances are profaned, and the glory that is instamped
thereon, little set by, Mal. i. 3, 4. Other sins reflect
dishonour on our Lord Jesus Christ; and that either on his
person, when we conclude him to be, or, at least, act as if he
were no other than a mere creature; or, on his offices; when
we refuse to receive instruction from him as a prophet, or depend
on his righteousness as a priest, in order to our justification
and acceptance, in the sight of God; or to submit to him
as a King, who is able to subdue us to himself, and defend us
from the assaults of our spiritual enemies; or when we despise
his grace, and neglect that salvation which he has purchased,
and offers in the gospel, Heb. ii. 3.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, our sins are aggravated when they are committed against
the person of the Holy Ghost; when we deny him to be
a divine Person, or the author of the work of regeneration, as
supposing that grace takes its rise from ourselves, rather than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>him; or when we do not desire to be led by the Spirit, or seek
his divine influence in order thereunto. But, on the other
hand, resist his holy motions and impressions, and act contrary
to those convictions which he is pleased to grant us; by
which means we are said to <i>grieve</i> and <i>quench the spirit</i>, Eph.
iv. 7. 1 Thess. v. 19. Also, when we reject and set ourselves
against the witness of the Spirit, and that, either by concluding,
that assurance of our interest in the love of God, may be attained
without it, and reckon all pretences to it no better than enthusiasm;
or, when on the other hand, we suppose that the
Spirit witnesses with our spirits, that we are the children of
God, without regard had to the work of sanctification, that
always accompanies, and is an evidence thereof; whereby we
take that comfort to ourselves which does not proceed from
the Spirit of holiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Sins are aggravated as committed more immediately or
directly against men, and particularly those, to whom we stand
related in the bonds of nature, or, who have laid us under the
strongest obligations, by acts of friendship to us. This is applicable
to inferiors, who ought to pay a deference to their superiors;
those sins that are committed by such, contain the
highest instance of ingratitude, and are contrary to the laws or
dictates of nature, and therefore aggravated in proportion thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, if they are committed against the saints; this is
reckoned, by God, an instance of contempt cast on himself,
(whose image they are said to bear;) much more, if we oppose
them as saints, Luke xvi. 16. Matt. xii. 6. And though
we do not proceed to this degree of wickedness, our crime is
said to be greatly aggravated, when we lay a stumbling-block
before those who are weak in the faith, which may tend to discourage
them in the ways of God; and, by this means, we do
what in us lies, to <i>destroy those for whom Christ died</i>, Rom.
xiv. 15. 1 Cor. viii. 11. This is an injury done, not so much
to their bodies, as their souls; which are wounded, and brought
into great perplexity thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, we must distinguish between an offence given,
and unjustly taken; or, it is one thing for persons to be offended
at that which is our indispensible duty, in which case we
are not to regard the sentiments of those who attempt to discourage
us from, or censure us for the performance of it; and
our giving offence in things that are in themselves indifferent,
and might, without any prejudice, be avoided; in which case
a compliance with the party offended, seems to be our duty;
especially if the offence takes its rise from conscience, rather,
than humour and corruption; and our not complying with him
herein, would tend very much to discourage and weaken his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>hands in the ways of God; and therefore may be reckoned an
aggravation of this sin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, it is a farther aggravation of sin committed, when
it appears to be contrary to the common good of all men.
This guilt may be said to be contracted by them who endeavour
to hinder the success of preaching of the gospel, 1 Thess.
ii. 15. or otherwise, when the sin of one man brings down the
judgments of God on a whole church or body of people; of
this kind was Achan’s sin, Josh. vii. 20, 21, 25.</p>

<p class='c013'>III. Sins are aggravated from the nature and quality of the offence;
if it be against the express letter of the law, break
many commandments, contain in it many sins; if not only
conceived in the heart, but breaks forth in words and actions,
scandalize others, and admit of no reparation; if against
means, mercies, judgments, light of nature, conviction of
conscience; public or private admonition, censures of the
church, civil punishments, and our prayers, purposes, promises;
vows, covenants, and engagements to God or men;
if done deliberately, wilfully, presumptuously, impudently,
boastingly, maliciously, frequently, obstinately, with delight,
continuance, or relapsing after repentance.</p>

<p class='c011'>1. Sin is aggravated when it is committed against the express
letter of the law, so that there remains no manner of doubt,
whether it be a sin or duty. To venture on the commission
of what plainly appears to be unlawful, is to sin with great
boldness and presumption, whereby the crime is very much
aggravated, Rom. i. 32.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. When it contains a breach of several of the Commandments;
and therefore it may be reckoned a complicated crime.
Of this kind was the sin of David, in the matter of Uriah; in
which he was guilty of murder, adultery, dissimulation, injustice,
<i>&amp;c.</i> Also Ahab’s sin against Naboth; which included in
it not only covetousness, but perjury, murder, oppression, and
injustice.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Sins are more aggravated, when they break forth in words,
or outward actions, than if they were only conceived in the
heart. It is true, sin in the heart has some peculiar aggravations,
as it takes deeper root, becomes habitual, and is entertained
with a secret delight and pleasure, and as it is the source
and fountain, from whence actual sins proceed. Nevertheless,
when that, which was before conceived in the heart, is discovered
by words or actions, this adds a farther aggravation to it,
as it brings a more public dishonour to God, and often-times
a greater injury to men.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Sins are farther aggravated, when they are of such a nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>that it is impossible for us to repair the injuries done
thereby, or make restitution for them. Thus nothing can
compensate for our taking away the life of another, or for our
casting a reproach on the holy ways of God; and thereby endeavouring
to bring his gospel into contempt; or, when we
entice others to sin, by which means we turn them aside from
God, and endeavour to ruin their souls; which is an injury
that we cannot, by any means, repair; and therefore the crime
is exceedingly aggravated.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. If the sin committed be contrary to the very light of
nature, such as would be offensive, even to the Heathen, 1
Cor. v. 1.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Sins receive their aggravations, when committed against
means, mercies, and judgments; as when we break through all
the fences which are set to prevent them; and the grace of
God, revealed in the gospel, is not only ineffectual, to preserve
from sin, though designed for that end, Tit. ii. 11, 12. but
turned into lasciviousness, Jude, ver. 4. When mercies are
misimproved, undervalued, and, as it were, trampled on,
Rom. ii. 4. Isa. i. 3, Deut. xxii. 6. and judgments, whether
threatened or inflicted are not regarded, nor were claimed
thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. Sins are farther aggravated, when they are committed
against the checks and convictions of conscience; which is a
judge and a reprover within our own breasts. This is an
offering violence to ourselves, and making many bold advances
towards judicial blindness, hardness of heart, and a total
apostacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. When the sins committed are against public or private
admonitions, censures of the church or civil punishments,
which are God’s ordinance to bring men to repentance; and if
they prove ineffectual, to answer that end, they will be left
more stupid than they were before.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. Sins are farther aggravated, when they are contrary to
our own prayers, vows, covenants, and promises made either
to God or men. When we confess sin, or pretend to humble
ourselves before God in prayer, and yet, at other times, indulge
the same sins, and are proud, self-conceited, and exalt ourselves
against him; or when we pray for strength against corruption,
or grace to perform holy duties, when, in reality, we
have no love to, nor desire after them; or when we praise him
for mercies received, while we are habitually unthankful, and
forgetful of his benefits. Moreover, when we are very forward
to make vows, covenants, or engagements, to be the Lord’s;
whereby we often lay a snare for ourselves, from some circumstances
that attend this action; and more especially from
our disregarding it afterwards.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>10. Sins are aggravated from the manner of our committing
them, <i>viz.</i> If they are done deliberately, with fore-thought or
contrivance: As when persons are said to devise mischief upon
their beds; and then as to their conversation, to set themselves
against that which is good, Psal. xxxiv. 5. Again, if it
be done wilfully, that is, with the full bent of the will, making
it the matter of our choice, and resolving to commit it, whatever
it cost us. When we do it presumptuously, either when we
take encouragement hereunto from the grace of God, Rom.
vi. 1. or when his hand is lifted up against us, or when we
see his judgments falling very heavy upon others, and are not
disposed to take warning thereby; but grow more hardened
and stupid than before.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, when sin is committed maliciously impudently, and
obstinately; this argues a rooted hatred against God. Or,
when it is committed with delight arising either from the
thoughts we entertain thereof, before we commit it; or the
pleasure we take in what we have done, afterwards. Again,
when we boast of what we have done, which is to glory in our
shame, Psal. x. 3. and lii. 1. when we do, as it were, value
ourselves for having got rid of the prejudices of education, and
all former convictions of sin, that so we may go on therein
with less disturbance. And when persons boast of their over-reaching
others in their way of dealing in the world, Prov.
xx. 14. which they very often do in their secret thoughts,
when they are ashamed to let the world know how remote they
are from the practice of that justice, that ought to be between
man and man. Again sins are aggravated when they are frequently
committed, or when we relapse into the same sin, after
having pretended to repent of it, 2 Pet. ii. 20,-22. Matt.
xii. 43,-45.</p>

<p class='c013'>IV. Sins are aggravated from circumstances of time, and
place; if on the Lord’s-day, or other times of divine worship,
or immediately before, or after these, or other helps,
to prevent or remedy such miscarriages, if in public, or in
the presence of others who are thereby likely to be provoked
or defiled.</p>

<p class='c011'>When sins are committed by us on the Lord’s-day, it is a
profaning that time which he has sanctified for his service, and
so renders us guilty of a double crime; or, when they are
committed at any other time, which we occasionally set apart
for divine worship; or, in those seasons, when God calls for
fasting and mourning for our own sins, or those that are
publicly committed in the world, Isa. xxii. 12,-14. or, at
other times, when we have lately received signal deliverances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>either personal or national, Psal. cvi. 7. or, when they are
committed immediately before or after we have engaged in
holy duties; the former renders us very unfit for them; the
latter will effectually take away all those impressions, which
have been made on our spirits therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, sins receive aggravation from the place in which
they are committed: As for instance, if they are committed
in those places, in which the name of God is more immediately
called on, which if visible, will afford great matter of scandal
to some, and an ill example to others; and if secretly
committed, will tend to defile our souls, and argue us guilty
of great hypocrisy. Moreover, when we commit those sins,
which are generally abhorred in the place where providence
has cast our lot: This is to render ourselves a stain and dishonour
to those with whom we converse. Thus the prophet
speaks of some, who, <i>in the land of uprightness</i>, will <i>deal unjustly</i>,
Isa. xxvi. 10. and especially when they are committed
in the presence of others, who are likely to be provoked or
defiled thereby; by which means we contract the guilt of other
men’s sins, as well as our own; and are doubly guilty, in that
we are, in many respects, the cause of their transgressing.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are several instances in which we may be said to
contract the guilt of other men’s sins, which I shall only mention
briefly, <i>viz.</i> when superiors lay their commands on inferiors,
or oblige them to do that which is in itself sinful; or,
when we advise those who stand upon a level with us, to commit
sin, or give our consent to the commission of it, Acts vii.
58. chap. vii. 1. Again, when inferiors flatter superiors, or
commend them for their sin: Thus when Herod had courted
the applause of the people, by the oration which he made to
them; they, on the other hand, flattered him, when they <i>gave
a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man</i>, chap.
xii. 22. Again, when we have recourse to those places, where
sin is usually committed, and desire to associate ourselves with
them, whose conversation is a reproach to religion, Prov. xiii.
20. or, when we are sharers, or partakers, with others, in their
unlawful gains; first encouraging, abetting, and helping them
therein; and then dividing the spoil with them, chap. i. 23,-25.
Again, when we connive at sin committed; or, if it be in
our power, do not restrain or hinder the commission of it; or,
when we conceal it, when the farther progress thereof might
be prevented by our divulging it. Again, when we provoke
persons to sin. And hereby draw forth their corruptions; and
when we extenuate sin, whether committed by ourselves or
others; which is a degree of vindicating, or pleading for it.
And lastly, when we do not mourn for, or pray against those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>sins which are publicly committed in the world, that are like
to bring down national judgments<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLII., CLIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLII.</span> <i>What doth every sin deserve at the hands of
God?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Every sin, even the least, being against the sovereignty,
goodness, and holiness of God, and, against his righteous
law, deserveth his wrath and curse, both in this life, and
that which is to come, and cannot be expiated, but by the
blood of Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLIII.</span> <i>What doth God require of us, that may
escape his wrath and curse due to us by reason of the transgression
of the law.</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> That we may escape the wrath and curse of God due
to us by reason of the transgression of the law, he requireth of
us repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus
Christ, and the diligent use of the outward means whereby
Christ communicates to us the benefits of his mediation.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the former of these answers, we have an account of then
demerit of sin; in the latter, we have the character and
disposition of those who have ground to conclude that they
shall be delivered from the wrath and curse of God due to it.
We have already considered one sin as greater than another,
by reason of several circumstances that tend to enhance the
guilt of those who commit them: Nevertheless, there is no
sin so small but it has this aggravation in it, that it is a violation
of the law of God, and is opposite to his holiness; and
therefore it cannot but render the sinner guilty in his sight;
and guilt is that whereby a person is liable to suffer punishment
in proportion to the offence committed: Therefore it
follows, that there is no ground for that distinction which the
Papists make between <i>mortal</i> and <i>venial</i> sins; whereof the
former, they suppose, deserves the wrath and curse of God
both in this and another world; but as for the latter, namely,
<i>venial</i> sins, they conclude that they may be atoned for by human
satisfactions, or penances; and that they are, in their own
nature, so small, that they do not deserve eternal punishment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>This is an opinion highly derogatory to the glory of God, and
opens a door to licentiousness, in a variety of instances; the
contrary to which, is contained in the answer we are now explaining.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the understanding whereof, let it be considered; that it
is one thing for a sin to deserve the wrath and curse of God,
and another thing for the sinner to be liable and exposed to it.
The former of these arises from the heinous nature of sin,
and is inseparable from it; the latter is inconsistent with
a justified state. Nothing can take away the guilt of sin,
but the atonement made by Christ; and that forgiveness or
freedom from condemnation, which God is pleased to bestow
as the consequence thereof, Rom. viii. 1, 33. It is this that
discharges a believer from a liableness to the wrath and curse
of God. Though one sin be greater than another, by reason
of various circumstances that attend, or are contained in it, as
was observed under the last answer: yet the least sin must be
concluded to be objectively infinite, as it is committed against
a God of infinite perfection, since all offences are great in
proportion to the dignity of the person against whom they
are committed. Thus the same sin that is committed against
an inferior, or an equal, which deserves a less degree of punishment,
if it be committed against a king, may be so circumstanced,
as that it will be deemed a capital offence, and
render the criminal guilty of high treason; though, at the
same time, no real injury is done to, but only attempted
against him. In like manner we must conclude, that though
it be out of our own power to injure or detract from the
essential glory of the great God; yet every offence committed
against him is great, in proportion to his infinite excellency;
and is therefore said to deserve his wrath and curse. Wrath
or anger, when applied to God, is not to be considered as a
passion in him, as it is in men; but denotes his will to punish
sin committed, which takes its first rise from the holiness of
his nature, which is infinitely opposite to it. And the degree
of punishment that he designs to inflict, is contained in
his law; which, as it denounces threatnings against those who
violate it, the sinner is hereby said to be exposed to the curse
or condemning sentence thereof, agreeably to the rules of
justice, and the nature of the offence. This is what we are
to understand, in this answer, by sin’s deserving the wrath and
curse of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this is farther considered, as what extends itself to
this life, and that which is to come. Punishments inflicted in
this life, are but the beginning of miseries; but they are
sometimes inexpressibly great, as the Psalmist says, <i>Who
knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>so is thy wrath</i>, Psal. xc. 11. Sometimes there is but a very
short interval between sin and the punishment; as in the case
of Nadab and Abihu, Korah, and his company, Achan, and
many others; whereas, at other times, it is long deferred;
nevertheless, it will fall with great weight, at last, on the offender.
Thus God sometimes punishes the sin of youth in old
age; and when a greater degree of guilt has been contracted,
writes bitter things against them, Job xiii. 26. But the greatest
degree of punishment is reserved for sinners in another
world; which is styled <i>the wrath to come</i>, 1 Thess. i. 10. But
these things having been insisted on in some foregoing answers<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a>,
we shall add no more on that head; but proceed to
what is farther observed, viz. that this punishment cannot be
expiated any otherwise than by the blood of Christ. This is
fitly inserted after the account we have had of man’s liableness
to the wrath of God, by reason of sin: for when we have
an afflicting sense of the guilt we have exposed ourselves to,
nothing else will afford us relief.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next thing to be considered is, how it may be removed,
or by what means the justice of God may be satisfied, and an
atonement made for sin. This is said to be done no other way
but by the blood of Christ, as has been considered elsewhere,
under a foregoing answer; in which we endeavoured to prove
the necessity of Christ’s making satisfaction, and the price that
he paid in order thereto<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a>. We have also considered the fruits
and effects thereof, as it has a tendency to remove the guilt of
sin, and procure for us a right to eternal life:<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Therefore, we
shall pass over the consideration thereof in this place; only
we may observe, that, since this can be brought about by no
other means but Christ’s satisfaction; it is not inconsistent
with what is contained in the following words, if rightly understood
by us, to assert that God requires of us, repentance,
faith, and a diligent attendance on the outward means of grace;
though we must not conclude them to be the procuring cause
of our justification, or a means to expiate sin. They are certainly
very much unacquainted with the way of salvation by
Christ, as well as the great defects of their repentance and
faith, who suppose, that God is hereby induced to pardon our
sins, or deliver us from the wrath we have deserved thereby;
nevertheless, we are not to think, that impenitent unbelieving
sinners have a right to determine that they are in a justified
state, or have ground to claim an interest in the benefits of
Christ’s redemption. Therefore, these graces are necessary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>evince our interest in what he has done and suffered for us,
and they are inseparably connected with salvation; though
they do not give us a right and title to eternal life, as Christ’s
righteousness doth. We have, in two foregoing answers,
given a particular account of repentance and faith. Concerning
repentance, we have observed, that it is a special saving
grace, wrought in us by the Holy Spirit, and have shewn in
what way he works it; and also the difference between legal and
evangelical repentance, as the former is often found in those
who are destitute of the latter. We have considered the various
acts of repentance unto life<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a>; what the objects and acts
of saving faith are; and how it differs from that which is not
so; and the use of this grace, in the whole conduct of our
lives, and how it gives life and vigour to all other graces, and
enables us to perform duties in a right manner<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a>. Therefore
we shall not insist on this subject at present, but only speak
of repentance and faith as means appointed by God, in order
to our attaining compleat salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The means conducive hereunto, are either internal or external;
the former of these are inseparably connected with salvation;
so that <i>none</i>, who repent and <i>believe, shall perish</i>, John
iii. 16. These graces, together with all others, that accompany
or flow from them, are the fruits and effects of Christ’s mediation;
and therefore they are sometimes called saving graces.
As they are wrought in the hearts of believers, and have a
reference to salvation; they may be truly styled internal means
of salvation; and, as such, they are distinguished from those
outward and ordinary means of grace, by which God is pleased
to work them. And these are the ordinances which we
are diligently to attend on, in hopes of attaining those graces
under them, till God is pleased to give success to our endeavours,
and work grace under these means; the efficacy whereof,
is wholly owing to his power, and is to be resolved into
his sovereign will.</p>

<p class='c006'>This may be fitly illustrated by what is said concerning the
poor, <i>impotent</i>, <i>blind</i>, <i>halt</i>, and <i>withered</i> persons, <i>waiting</i> at
the <i>pool of Bethesda</i>, for the <i>angels troubling the water</i>; after
which, he that <i>first stepped in, was made whole</i>, John v. 2-4.
Nevertheless, we do not find that every one who waited there
embraced the first opportunity, and received a cure; for some
were obliged to wait many years; and if they were made
whole at last, they had no reason to think their labour lost.
This may be applied to those who have the means of grace.
Many sit under them who receive no saving advantage thereby,
till God is pleased, in his accepted time, to work those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>graces which render these ordinances effectual to salvation.
This blessed success attending them, is from God; he could,
indeed, save his people without them, as he converted Paul,
when going to Damascus, with a design to persecute the
church there; being not only unacquainted with, but prejudiced
against the means of grace. But this is not God’s ordinary
method. He has put an honour on his own institutions,
so as to render it necessary for us to pray, wait and hope for saving
blessings, in attending on them. Thus when he promises
to <i>put his Spirit</i> within his people, and <i>cause them walk in
his statutes</i>, he adds; yet <i>for this will I be enquired of by the
house of Israel, to do it for them</i>, Ezek. xxxvi. 27, 37. accordingly
we are commanded to <i>seek the Lord while he may be
found, and to call upon him while he is near</i>, Isa. lv. 6. Hereby
we testify our approbation of that method which he has
ordained for the application of redemption; and by our perseverance
therein, as determining not to leave off waiting till we
have obtained the blessing expected, we proclaim the valuableness
thereof, and subscribe to the sovereignty of God, in dispensing
those blessings to his people, which they stand in need
of, as well as pray and hope for them in his own time and
way. Thus we are to wait on the means of grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>And it is farther observed, that this is to be done with diligence;
not in a careless and indifferent manner, as though we
neither expected nor desired much advantage from them. This
implies in it an embracing every opportunity, and observing
those special seasons, in which God is pleased, in his gospel,
to hold forth the golden sceptre of grace; as also our having
earnest desires and raised expectations of obtaining that grace
from him which he encourages us to wait and hope for<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Which leads us to speak particularly concerning those outward
means, as contained in the following answer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLIV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLIV.</span> <i>What are the outward means whereby Christ
communicates to us the benefits of his mediation?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The outward and ordinary means whereby Christ
communicates to his church the benefits of his mediation,
are, all his ordinances; especially the word, sacraments, and
prayer; all which are made effectual to the elect for salvation.</p>

<p class='c011'>In explaining this answer, we shall consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. What we are to understand by the ordinances, which
are here styled outward and ordinary means of grace. The
first idea contained in them is, that they are religious duties,
prescribed by God, as an instituted method, in which he will
be worshipped by his creatures; but that which more especially
denominates them to be ordinances, is, the promise which
he has annexed to them of his special presence, and the encouragement
that he has given to his people in attending on
them, to hope for those blessings that accompany salvation.
As God works grace by, and under them, they are called
means of grace; and because he seldom works grace without
first inclining persons to attend on him therein, and wait for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>his salvation; therefore they are called the ordinary means of
grace; and because they have not in themselves a tendency to
work grace, without the inward and powerful influences of the
Holy Spirit, accompanying them, they are distinguished from
it, and accordingly styled the outward means of grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which may be observed concerning the ordinances as
thus described, is,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That they may be engaged in, pursuant to a divine appointment;
therefore no creature hath a warrant to enjoin any
modes of worship, pretending that this will be acceptable, or
well-pleasing to God; since he alone, who is the object of
worship, has a right to prescribe the way in which he will be
worshipped. To do this would be an instance of profaneness
and bold presumption; and the worship performed pursuant
thereunto would be <i>in vain</i>; as our Saviour says concerning
that which has no higher a sanction than <i>the commandments
of men</i>, Matt. xv. 9. and whatever pretence of religion there
may be therein, God looks upon such worshippers as well as
those whose prescriptions they follow herein, with the utmost
contempt, and will punish them for, rather than encourage
them in it. Thus the prophet reproves Israel, as being guilty
of defection from God, who engaged in that worship which
he had not ordained, when he says, <i>The statutes of Omri are
kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in
their counsels, that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants
thereof an hissing. Therefore shall ye bear the reproach
of my people</i>, Mic. vi. 16. And Jeroboam is often
branded with this character, that <i>he made Israel to sin</i>, for instituting
ordinances of divine worship, and <i>setting up calves
in Dan and Bethel, making an house of high places, and priests
of the lowest of the people</i>, and appointing sacred times, in
which they should perform this worship; all which were of
his own devising, and became a snare to the people, Exod.
xx. 24. It is certain, that such appointments cannot be reckoned
means of grace, or pledges of God’s presence; and it
would redound to his dishonour, should he be obliged to communicate
the benefits of Christ’s redemption hereby, to any
who, (under a pretence of worshipping him in a way of their
own devising,) offer the highest affront to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. If God is pleased to reveal his will concerning the way
in which we are to worship him, and hope for his presence, it
is our indispensable duty to comply with it, and implore his
acceptance of us herein; and be importunate with him, that he
would put a glory on his own institutions, and grant us his
special presence and grace, that we may be enabled to perform
whatever duty he enjoins, in such a manner, that the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>valuable ends may be answered, and our spiritual edification
and salvation promoted thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Though we consider the ordinances as instituted means
of grace; yet, a bare attendance on them will not, of itself,
confer grace, as is very evident from the declining state of religion,
in those who engage in the external part of it, and attend
upon all the ordinances of God’s appointment, and yet
remain destitute of saving grace; who are stupid under the
awakening calls of the gospel, and regard not the invitations
given therein, to adhere stedfastly to Jesus Christ, whom in
words they profess to own, though in works they deny him.
This is a convincing evidence, that it is God alone, who appointed
those ordinances, that can make them effectual to salvation.
Thus concerning the nature of an ordinance, and in
what respect it may be called an outward and ordinary means
of grace. We are now,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. To consider what are those ordinances by which Christ
communicates to us the benefits of his mediation. These may
be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As engaged in by particular persons, as subservient to
their spiritual welfare, in order to the beginning or carrying
on the work of grace in their souls; such as meditation about
divine subjects, self-examination, and all other duties, which
are performed by them in their private retirement, in hope of
having communion with God therein. Or,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. There are other ordinances which God has given to worshipping
assemblies, which are founded in that general promise,
<i>In all places where I record my name, I will come unto
thee, and I will bless thee</i>, Exod. xx. 24. Those mentioned in
this answer, are the words, sacraments and prayer; of which
the sacraments are particularly given to the churches; the
word and prayer, to all who are favoured with the gospel-dispensation.
And to these we may add, singing the praises of
God; which, though it be not particularly mentioned in this
answer, is, nevertheless, a duty wherein we may expect to
meet with his presence and blessing; and accordingly is an
ordinance which God makes effectual to promote our salvation.
Therefore, before we enter on the subject-matter of the following
answers, we shall speak something concerning this
duty, as an ordinance which he has instituted; together with
the way and manner in which it is to be performed. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) We may enquire what ground we have to reckon it
among the ordinances of God. This must not be taken for
granted, but proved; because there are many who deny it to
be so. That it was an ordinance enjoined to, and practised
by the church, under the Old Testament-dispensation, appears
from the many songs and psalms given, by divine inspiration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>to be used by the church, in their solemn acts of worship;
some of which were not only sung by particular persons; but
the whole church is represented as joining therein with united
voices. Thus when Pharaoh’s host was drowned in the red
sea, it is said, <i>Moses and the children of Israel sang</i> the song
that was given by divine inspiration for that purpose, contained
in Exod. xv. And when he was inspired with that song,
in Deut. xxxii. he was commanded, in chap. xxxi. <i>to write it
for them, and teach it to them, and put it in their mouths</i>; that
they might sing it in their public worship; which he did accordingly,
ver. 22. And from the days of David, when public
worship was more settled than it had been before; and
many things relating to the order, beauty and harmony thereof,
brought into the church by divine direction, then there was an
order of men called <i>Singers</i>, who were to preside over, and
set forward the work. And there was also a book of psalms,
given by divine inspiration, for the use of the church therein,
that they might not be at a loss as to the subject-matter of
praise in this ordinance; as may be inferred from the style
thereof, the words being often put in the plural number; which
argues, that they were to be sung, not by one person in the
church, but by the whole congregation, in their solemn and
public acts of worship; and accordingly we often find the
whole multitude of them exhorted to sing the praises of God.
Thus it is said in Psal. xxx. 4. <i>Sing unto the Lord, O ye
saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</i>
And elsewhere, <i>Sing aloud unto God our strength.
Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. Take a psalm</i>, &amp;c.
<i>For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob</i>,
Psal. lxxxi. 1, 2, 3, 4. And sometimes the church are represented
as exciting one another to this duty. Thus it is said,
<i>O come let us sing unto the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to
the rock of our salvation. Let us come before his presence with
thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms</i>,
Psal. xcv. 1, 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>And it may be observed, that how much soever the use of
musical instruments, which were in this worship may be concluded
to be particularly adapted to that dispensation, as they
were typical of that spiritual joy, which the gospel church
should obtain by Christ; yet the ordinance of singing remains
a duty, as founded on the moral law; and accordingly we find,
that the practice hereof was recommended, not only to the Jews,
but to all nations. Thus it is said, <i>Make a joyful noise unto
the Lord all the earth</i>, Psal. xcviii. 4. And he speaks to this
purpose, when he presses this duty upon <i>all lands</i>, whom he
exhorts to <i>serve him with gladness; and to come before the Lord
with singing</i>, Psal. c. 1, 2. And besides, it seems to be preferred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>before some other parts of worship, which were merely
ceremonial. Thus the Psalmist says, <i>I will praise the name
of God with a song. This also shall please the Lord better than
an ox or bullock</i>, Psal. lxix. 30, 31. that is, God is more glorified
hereby than he is by the external rites of ceremonial
worship; especially when abstracted from those acts of faith,
which add an excellency and glory to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this leads us to consider it as an ordinance practised
by the New Testament-church. Some had songs given in to
them by inspiration; as the virgin Mary, Zacharias, and Simeon,
Luke i. 46, 47, &amp; <i>seq.</i> chap. ii. 28, &amp; <i>seq.</i> and sometimes
the members of particular churches had a psalm given
in by extraordinary revelation, 1 Cor. xiv. 26. and we can
hardly suppose this to have been without a design that it
should be sung in the church for their edification; especially
considering it as an extraordinary dispensation of the Spirit:
And, as the singing of a psalm in the church, is an act of
public worship, it is reasonable to suppose, that the whole assembly
joined together therein; and therefore this ordinance
was not only practised by them, but had also a divine sanction,
in that the Spirit was the author of the psalm that was
sung: And we sometimes read of the church’s singing an
hymn, which was no other than a psalm or spiritual song, at
the Lord’s-supper: Thus our Saviour, in the close of that
ordinance, sung an hymn with his disciples, that small church
with whom he then communicated, Mark xiv. 26. And at
another time, when he was <i>come nigh to the descent of the
mount of olives</i>, it is said, that <i>the multitude of the disciples began
to rejoice, and to praise God with a loud voice</i>, Luke xxix.
37. where, by <i>the multitude of the disciples</i>, we must understand
all that followed him, who had, at that time, a conviction
in their consciences, that he was the Messiah, from the
miracles which they had seen him work; and we have an account
of the short hymn which they sang; <i>Blessed be the king
that cometh in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory
in the highest</i>, Luke xix. 38. This was not, indeed, sung
in a church-assembly; however, it was with a <i>loud voice</i>, and
herein they gave glory to God: And though some of the Pharisees
were offended at it, ver. 39. yet our Saviour, in the following
words, vindicates their practice herein; which argues,
that it was a branch of religious worship, performed by them
at that time; and a duty approved of by him. All that I would
infer from hence, is, that our Saviour gave countenance to the
singing the praises of God, with united voices. Therefore it
follows, that we ought, on all occasions, to do the same thing;
and consequently, singing is an ordinance, whereby the church
ought to glorify God, and shew forth his praise. Thus we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>have considered singing to be an ordinance, or a branch of instituted
worship.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) There are several things in which this ordinance agrees
with some others; particularly with prayer in all the parts
thereof; and with reading and preaching of the word. That
it has something in common with prayer, appears from the
subject-matter of several of the psalms of David; some of
which are called prayers, and accordingly they contain in them
several petitions, for blessings that the church stood in need of,
together with various instances of confession of sin, as well as
thanksgiving for mercies received. As to the agreement of
this ordinance, with preaching or reading the word; that, I
think, may be inferred in general, from one of the ends thereof,
mentioned by the apostle, namely, in that we are herein to
<i>teach and admonish one another</i>, Col. iii. 16. This is what the
Psalmist styles <i>talking of all his wondrous works</i>, Psal. cv. 1,
2. And elsewhere, the church are said to <i>speak to</i> themselves,
or to <i>one another</i> in this duty, Eph. v. 19. This may be observed
in the subject-matter of some of the psalms, in which
the Psalmist is represented as speaking to the church, and they
as making their reply to him: Thus he advises them to <i>lift
up their hands in the sanctuary, and bless the Lord</i>, Psal.
cxxxiv. 2. and answer him, <i>The Lord that made heaven and
earth bless thee out of Zion</i>, ver. 3. The name may be observed
in many other psalms, in which there is a frequent
change of the person speaking; and the subject-matter of the
whole book contains many admonitions or cautions necessary
to be observed by others, which they who sing, direct and apply
to each other. Again, this ordinance agrees with preaching
and reading the word, in that we are, in singing the praises
of God, to take notice of, or celebrate the dispensations of his
providence, either in a way of judgment or mercy; of this we
have many instances in the book of Psalms, as is very evident
in all those that are properly historical.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) We must, notwithstanding, suppose singing to be a
distinct ordinance from preaching, prayer, or reading the
word; for it is mentioned in scripture, as such; and that
wherein it principally differs, is, that it is designed to raise the
affections: and it is certain, that the modulation, or tone of
the voice, has oftentimes a tendency so to do. And because
the performing religious worship, with raised affections, is a
great duty and privilege; therefore God has appointed this as
an ordinance, in some degree conducive to answer that end.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 1. If the tone of the voice be to be reckoned an ordinance,
to raise the affections; then vocal or instrumental music
may be deemed sufficient to answer this end, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>making use of those words in singing, which God has ordained,
whereby it may be denominated a religious duty.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied; that to have the affections
raised, is no branch of religion, unless they are excited by those
ideas of divine things, in which it principally consists: Therefore,
that which is a means of raising the affections, may not
have a tendency to excite religious affections; and, consequently,
it is not barely singing, but celebrating the praises of
God therein, with raised affections, that is the duty and ordinance
which we ought to engage in: These two, therefore,
must be connected together; and if God is pleased, not only
to instruct us as to the matter about which our faith is to be
conversant, but to give us an ordinance conducive to the exciting
our affections therein, it must be reckoned an additional
advantage, and an help to our praising him in a becoming
manner.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 2. Those arguments that have been taken from the
practice of the Old Testament-church, to prove singing an ordinance,
may, with equal justice, be alleged to prove the use
of instrumental music therein; since we very often read of
their <i>praising</i> God with the <i>sound of the trumpet, psaltery,
harp, organ</i>, and other musical instruments, Psal. cl. 3, 4, 5.
which is the principal argument brought for the use of them
by those who defend this practice, and conclude it an help for
devotion.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied; that though we often
read of music being used in singing the praises of God under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>the Old Testament; yet if what has been said concerning its
being a type of that spiritual joy which attends our praising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>God for the privilege of that redemption which Christ has
purchased be true; then this objection will appear to have no
weight, since this type is abolished, together with the ceremonial
law. And it may be farther observed, that though we
read of the use of music, in the temple-service, yet it does not
sufficiently appear, that it was ever used, in the Jewish synagogues;
wherein the mode of worship more resembled that
which is, at present, performed by us in our public assemblies.
But that which may sufficiently determine this matter,
is, that, we have no precept or precedent for it in the New
Testament, either from the practice of Christ, or his apostles.
And inasmuch as this is alleged, by some, to overthrow the
ordinance of singing, who pretend, that it ought to be no more
used by us than the harp, organ, or other musical instruments:
It might as well be objected, that, because incense, which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>used under the ceremonial law, together with prayer in the
temple, Luke i. 9, 10. is not now offered by us; therefore
prayer ought to be laid aside; which is, as all own, a duty
founded on the moral law.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) In singing those psalms or songs, which are given by
divine inspiration, we are not to consider the subject-matter
thereof, as always expressive of the frame of our own spirits,
or denoting the dispensations of providence, which we,
or the church of God are, at present exercised with. This
is necessary in order to our singing with understanding; and
it may be inferred from what is observed under the second of
those heads, before laid down, relating to the agreement which
there is between singing and reading any of David’s psalms.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must be allowed by all, that we ought to have the same
acts of faith in one, as we have in the other. This is evident
from all composures in prose or verse, whether divine
or human. If the subject-matter be historical, whatever the
form be in which it is laid down, the principal things to be
considered are, those matters of fact which are therein related.
If an history be written in prose, and the same should be turned
into verse; its being laid down in the form of a poem,
though it adds something of beauty to the mode of expression,
yet the ideas, that are conveyed thereby, or the historical representation
of things, are the same as though they had not
been written in verse. It may be, the reading the same history
in verse, may add something of pleasure and delight to
those ideas which we have of it, in like manner as singing,
according to the third head before mentioned, is a distinct
ordinance from reading (though the matter be the same, as
it respects the exciting the affections;) yet this does not give
us different ideas of it; much less are we to take occasion
from thence, to apply those things to ourselves that are spoken
of others; unless parallel circumstances require it. If this
rule be not observed, I do not see how we can sing many of
the psalms of David. Sometimes the subject-matter thereof
is not agreeable to every age of life, or the universal experience
of particular persons. It would be very preposterous
for a child, in singing those words, <i>I have been young, and
now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor
his seed begging bread</i>, Psal. xxxvii. 25. or what is elsewhere
said; <i>Now also, when I am old and gray-headed, O God, forsake
me not</i>, Psal. lxxi. 18. to apply them, in particular to
himself. And when some other psalms are sung in a public
assembly, in which God’s people are represented as dejected,
disconsolate, and, as it were, sinking in the depths of despair;
as when the Psalmist says, <i>My soul refused to be comforted.
I remembered God, and was troubled; I complained,
and my spirit was overwhelmed</i>, Psal. lxxvii. 2, 3. and elsewhere,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span><i>I am counted with them that go down into the pit.
Thy wrath lieth hard upon me. While I suffer thy terrors, I
am distracted</i>, Psal. lxxxviii. 4, 7, 15. This cannot be applied
to every particular person in a worshipping assembly; as denoting
that frame of spirit in which he is, at present, any more
than those expressions which we meet with elsewhere, which
speak of a believer, as having full assurance of God’s love to
him, and his right and title to eternal life; as when it is said,
<i>Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive
me to glory</i>, Psal. lxxiii. 24. can be applied to those who are
in a dejected, despairing, or unbelieving frame of spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>And those psalms which contain an historical account of
some particular dispensations of providence towards the church
of old, cannot be applied to it in every age, or to the circumstances
of every believer; as when it is said, <i>By the rivers of
Babylon there we sat down; yea, we wept when we remembered
Zion</i>, Psal. cxxxvii. 1. This is not to be considered as
what is expressive of our own case, when we are, in the present
day, singing that psalm, Or, when, on the other hand, the
church is represented as praising God for particular deliverances,
as in Psal. cvii. or expressing its triumphs in the victories
obtained over its enemies, as in Psal. cxlix. these are
not to be applied, by particular persons, to themselves; especially
at all times. And when the Psalmist makes use of
those phrases which are adapted to the ceremonial law, as
when he speaks of <i>binding the sacrifice with cords, even unto
the horns of the altar</i>, Psal. cxviii. 27. or elsewhere, of their
<i>offering bullocks upon it</i>, Psal. li. 19. this cannot be taken in
a literal sense, when applied to the gospel-state. And when
we are exhorted to <i>praise God with the psaltery</i>, &amp;c. Psal. cl.
we are to express those acts of faith which are agreeable to
the present gospel-dispensation, which we are under; and the
general rule, which is applicable to all psalms of the like nature,
is, that with the same frame of spirit with which we read
them, we ought to sing them. Sometimes we are to consider
the subject-matter of them, as containing an account of those
providences which we are liable to, rather than those which we
are, at present, under; or what we desire, or fear, rather than
experience; and improve them so as to excite those graces
which ought to be exercised in like circumstances, when it
shall please God to bring us under them. With this frame of
spirit the psalms of David are to be sung, as well as read;
otherwise we shall be obliged to exclude several of them as
not fit to be used in gospel-worship, which I would assert
nothing that should give the least countenance to,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a> any more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>than I would affirm that such-like psalms are not to be read
in public assemblies.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 1. To what has been said concerning our using David’s
psalms in singing the praises of God, it is objected, that some
of them contain such imprecation, or desires, that God would
destroy his enemies, Psal. lv. 15. and lix. 13-15. and lxix.
22-25, 27, 28. as are inconsistent with the spirit of the gospel,
or that love which we are, therein, obliged to express towards
our enemies, agreeably to the command and practice of
the holy Jesus, Matt. v. 44, 46. Luke xxiii. 34.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before I proceed to a direct answer to this objection, it
may be observed, that this is generally alleged, by the Deists,
with a design to cast a reproach on divine revelation; and
from hence they take occasion, outrageously to inveigh against
David, as though he was of a malicious and implacable spirit;
upon which account they will hardly allow him to have been
a good man, since these, and such-like imprecations of the
wrath of God on the church’s enemies, are reckoned by them
no other than the effects of his passion and hatred of them;
and therefore it is a preposterous thing to suppose, that his
psalms were given by divine inspiration.</p>

<p class='c006'>And there are others, to wit, some among the Socinians,
who give a different turn to such-like expressions; and pretend,
that under the Old Testament dispensation, it was not
unlawful for persons to hate their enemies, or curse, or imprecate
the wrath of God upon them, whereas, our Saviour
thought fit, under the New Testament-dispensation, to command
what was directly contrary thereunto. That it was formerly
lawful, they argue from what is said in Matt. v. 43.
<i>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour,
and hate thine enemy.</i> And the new Commandment
which he substituted in the room thereof, is contained in the
following words, in which he obliges them, to <i>love their enemies</i>,
&amp;c. But this is a gross mistake of the sense of that
scripture, which speaks of <i>hating</i> their <i>enemies</i>; since our
Saviour does not, in mentioning it, design to refer to any thing
said in the Old Testament, but only to expose the corrupt
gloss of the Scribes and Pharisees, given on some passages
contained therein. Therefore, we must conclude, that it was
equally unlawful to hate our enemies before, as it is now, under
the gospel-dispensation. These things I could not but
premise, before we come to a direct answer to this objection;
and, if what is contained therein were true, it would certainly
be unlawful to sing David’s psalms; yet, at the same time, it
would be a very difficult matter, to substitute any hymns and
songs in their room, which would be altogether unexceptionable;
and then the ordinance of singing would be effectually
overthrown.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span><i>Answ.</i> But to this it may be replied; that the words being
spoken by David, under divine inspiration, some of those
scriptures referred to, may, agreeably to the rules of grammar,
be understood as a prediction of those judgments which God
would execute on his implacable enemies; especially when the
word, that is supposed in the objection, to contain the form of
an imprecation, is put in the <i>future tense</i>, as it often is. And
if it be put in the <i>imperative mood</i>, as in other places, in
which it is said, <i>Let death seize on them; let them go down
quick into hell; let them be blotted out of the book of the living</i>;
this mode of speaking, especially when applied to God, contains
an intimation of what he would do, or the wrath which
he would pour forth, as a punishment of sin, committed, persisted
in, and not repented of. And, indeed, in one of these
psalms, <i>viz.</i> Psal. lxix. in which the righteous judgments of
God are denounced against sinners, the Psalmist plainly speaks
in the person of our Saviour, to whom the 9th and 21st verses
are expressly applied in the New Testament, John ii. 17.
Matt. xxvii. 34. Therefore, when he says, ver. 22. <i>Let their
table become a snare</i>, the meaning is, that God would deny
some of his furious and implacable enemies, that grace, which
alone could prevent their waxing worse and worse under outward
prosperity. And when he says, ver. 23. <i>Let their eyes
be darkened</i>; the meaning is, they shall be given up to judicial
blindness, as the Jews were; the providence of God permitting,
though not effecting it. And when it is said, ver. 23.
<i>Pour out thine indignation upon them</i>, it is an intimation that
this should come to pass. And, in ver. 25. <i>Let their habitation
be desolate</i>; the meaning is, that the land, in which they
dwelt, should be destitute of its former inhabitants, and so
contains a prediction of the desolate state of the Jewish nation,
after they were destroyed, and driven out of their country by
the Romans. And when he farther says, <i>Add iniquity to their
iniquity</i>; this may be accounted for consistently with the divine
perfections, and the sense thereof is not liable to any just
exception; as has been observed elsewhere. This I only
mention, to shew that it is not necessary to suppose that these
imprecations are always to be understood as what will warrant,
or give countenance to private persons to wish, or pray for the
destruction of their enemies.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, if the evil denounced be of a temporal nature;
as when the Psalmist is represented as desiring that his enemies
may be <i>consumed as the stubble before the wind</i>, or as <i>the
wood that fire burneth</i>, Psal. lxxxiii. 13, 14. these are not the
desires of one who meditates private revenge, or wishes to
see the ruin of those whom he hates. But they contain the
language of the church of God in general, as acquiescing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>his righteous judgments, which should be poured forth on
those that hate him, and persecute his people; and, if either
the church must be ruined, or those that set themselves against
it, removed out of the way, they cannot but desire the latter,
rather than the former. If such expressions be thus understood,
there would be no sufficient reason for that exception
that is taken against the book of the psalms; nor will any one
have just occasion to lay aside a part of them, as what cannot
be sung by a Christian congregation.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> 2. It is farther objected, that if singing could be
proved to be an ordinance, to be used by particular persons;
it will not follow from thence, that the whole congregation
ought to join with their voices together. It is sufficient if one
person sings, and others make melody in their hearts; whereas,
united voices in singing, will occasion confusion in the
worship of God; and, when a mixed multitude join in this
ordinance, it can hardly be supposed that they, all of them,
sing with the spirit, and with the understanding also. Therefore,
if one should sing, it is sufficient for them who are qualified
to join in this ordinance, to say, Amen; or, to have their
hearts engaged therein; as they have who join in public prayer,
in which, one is the mouth of the whole assembly.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied;</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That to insinuate that singing with united voices, is
confusion, is to cast a great reproach on that worship which
we often read of in scripture, which was performed in this
manner. Thus Moses and the children of Israel sang the
praises of God upon the occasion of their deliverance from the
Egyptians, in Exod. xvi. 1. which was certainly an act of
public worship, not performed by Moses alone, but by the
whole congregation.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, in the New Testament, there is a very remarkable
example of singing with united voices, our Saviour himself
being present, Mark xiv. 26. thus it is said, that he and his
disciples <i>sang an hymn</i>. The word is in the plural number<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a>;
therefore they all joined with their voices in singing; and
some observe, that it is not without design that it is said, <i>He</i>,
that is, Christ, <i>blessed the bread</i>, and <i>He gave thanks</i>, Mat.
xxvi. 26, 27. they only joining with him in their hearts, as
the congregation joins with the minister, who is their mouth
in public prayer. But when he speaks of the ordinance of singing,
they all join with their voices therein; and therefore, the
word, as was but now observed, is in the plural number, ver. 30.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] As to that part of the objection, which respects the congregation’s
joining in the heart, with one that sings with the
voice, in like manner as we do in prayer; let it be considered,
that though he that joins with the heart, with another that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>prays, may be said to perform the duty of prayer, though he
does not express his desires with his own voice; yet joining
with the heart, while one only sings, cannot properly speaking,
be called singing; much less singing with the voice, or singing
with a loud voice, as it is often expressed in scripture. The
apostle, indeed, speaks of <i>singing and making melody in our
hearts, to the Lord</i>, Eph. v. 19. which, in some measure, seems
to favour the objection. And it is inferred from hence, that,
if one sings with the voice, others may make melody in the
heart. But I take the meaning of that scripture to be this; the
apostle is pressing the church to sing, that is, to make melody
to the Lord; and, that this ordinance may be performed in a
right manner, the heart ought to go along with the voice;
hereby intimating, that there ought not only to be a melodious
sound, by which the praises of God are sung, but, together
with this, suitable acts of faith ought to be put forth, whereby
we worship him with our hearts, as well as our voices. This
does not therefore prove, that the melody here spoken of, only
respects the frame of spirit, as excluding the use of the voice
in singing.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] As to what is objected against the inexpediency of joining
in singing, with a mixed multitude, in which, some must
be supposed to want two necessary qualifications for singing,
namely, the Spirit and understanding; this is to join in the
external ordinance, where there is no harmony, as to the internal
frame of spirit, or the exercise of faith, which alone
makes it pleasing to God.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this it may be replied; that, if a mixed multitude may
join together in prayer, and particularly the Psalms of David,
may be read in the public congregation; though, perhaps,
there are many present who do not understand the meaning of
every particular phrase used therein: yet it does not follow,
that because we do not fully understand the Psalms of David,
therefore they ought not to be sung by us. We have before
observed, that there is no essential difference, especially as to
what concerns the frame of our spirit, between singing and
reading<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a>. Therefore it follows, that whatever psalm may be
read, may be sung. He that is not qualified for the latter is
not qualified for the former. The apostle, indeed, speaks of
his <i>praying</i> and <i>singing with the Spirit</i>, as well as <i>with the
understanding</i>; but the meaning of that is, that we ought to
desire the efficacious influences of the Spirit, and press after
the knowledge of the meaning of the words we use, either in
prayer or singing; yet the defect of our understanding, or
having a less degree thereof than others, or, than we ought to
have, does not exempt us from a right to engage in this ordinance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Therefore, we are not to refuse to join with those in
singing the praises of God, whom we would not exclude from
our society, if we were reading any of the Psalms of David in
public.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) We are now to consider the matter to be sung. There
are very few who allow singing to be an ordinance, that will
deny it to be our duty to sing the Psalms of David, and other
spiritual songs, which we frequently meet with in scripture.
Some, indeed, have contested the expediency of a Christian
assembly’s making use of several Old Testament-phrases, that
are contained therein. And others have alleged, that the
phrase ought to be altered in many instances, (especially in
those which have a peculiar reference to the Psalmist’s personal
circumstances,) and others substituted in their room,
which are matter of universal experience. But, if what has
been said under the last head, be true, this argument will appear
to have less weight in it; inasmuch as all the arguments
that are brought in defence of making these alterations in the
Psalms, as they are to be sung by us, will equally hold good,
as applicable to the ordinance of reading them, and, it may be,
will as much evince the necessity of altering the phrase of
scripture, in several other parts thereof, as well as in these, if
what has been said under the second head be allowed of. For
it will follow from thence, that if some psalms are not to be
sung by a Christian assembly, in the words in which they
were at first delivered, and consequently are not to be read by
them; because the phrase thereof is not agreeable to the state
of the Christian church; and therefore it is to be altered, when applied
to our present use; the same may be said concerning other
parts of scripture; and then the word of God, as it was at first
given to us, is no more to be read, than to be sung by us<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what is objected concerning the inexpediency of our
making use of those words, and applying them to our case, in
our devotions, that David used in his, with a peculiar view to
his own condition. What has been said under the fourth
head, relating to the frame of spirit with which the psalms are
to be sung, will very much weaken the force of it; and this is
what, in a great measure, determines my sentiments as to the
ordinance of conjoint singing, as well as the matter of it; for,
I am well persuaded, that if the words were to be considered
as our own, (as they ought to be, when joining with another,
who is our mouth, to God in prayer,) there are very few
psalms, or hymns of human composure, that can be sung by
a mixed assembly. But as a divine veneration ought to be
paid to the psalms, and they are to be read with those acts of
faith which are the main ingredients in our devotions; we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>to sing them with the same view, only with this difference; as
making use of the tone of the voice, as a farther help to the
raising our affections therein, as has been before observed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next thing to be considered is, what version of the
Psalms is to have the preference in our esteem, as it is subservient
to the design of this ordinance. It is not my business,
under this head, to criticise on the various versions of
the Psalms; nor can it be supposed, that I have a regard to
those poetical beauties in which one version exceeds another;
for then I should be inclined to think some of them, which I
do not make use of in the ordinance of singing, much preferable
to others, for the exactness of their style and composure.
But when I am singing the praises of God, in, or as near as I
can to, the words of David, or any other inspired writer; that
which I principally regard is, the agreeableness of the version
to the original; and then they may be sung with the same
frame of spirit with which they are to be read; and I am not
obliged in singing, to consider the words as expressive of my
own frame of spirit, any more than I am in reading them.
But if the composure cannot properly be called a version, but
an imitation of David’s Psalms, then I make use of it in the
ordinance of singing, with the same view as I would an hymn;
of which, more hereafter<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The versions which, I think, come nearest to the original,
are the New-England and the Scots; the latter of which, I
think, much preferable to the former; inasmuch as the sentences
are not so transposed in this, as in the other, and the
lines are much more smooth and pleasant to be read. I should
be very glad to see a version more perfect, that comes as near
the sense of the original, and excels it in the beauty or elegancy
of style. And it would be a very great advantage if
some marginal notes were added, as a comment upon it;
which would be a help to our right understanding thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall now give my thoughts concerning the singing of
hymns. These, according to the common acceptation of the
word, are distinguished from psalms, and they generally denote
a human composure, fitted for singing; the matter
whereof, contains some divine subjects, in words agreeable to,
or deduced from scripture. The arguments that are generally
brought in defence thereof, are, that though scripture be a rule
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>of faith, from whence all the knowledge of divine things is
primarily deduced; and therefore it has the preference, as to
the excellency and authority thereof, to any other composure;
yet it is not only lawful, but necessary to express our faith in
the doctrines contained therein, in other words, as we do in
prayer or preaching. Therefore, if it be a duty to praise God
with the voice, it is not unlawful to praise him in words agreeable
to scripture, as well as in the express words thereof; accordingly
it is argued, that both may be proved to be a duty,
<i>viz.</i> praising God in the words of David, and by other songs
contained in scripture, and praising him in words agreeable
thereunto, though of human composure. This is the best
method of reasoning that I have met with in defence of the
lawfulness of singing hymns, not as opposed to, or excluding
David’s Psalms, but as used occasionally, as providence directs
us; that so our acknowledgments of benefits received,
may be insisted on with greater enlargement than they are in
the book of Psalms; wherein, though it may be, there is something
adapted to every case, yet the particular occasion of our
praise is not so largely contained in the same section or paragraph;
and therefore an hymn may be composed on that occasion,
in order to our praising God thereby. But, when on
the other hand, persons seem to prefer hymns to David’s
Psalms, and substitute them in the room thereof, I cannot but
disapprove of their practice.</p>

<p class='c006'>A late writer<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a> speaks on this subject with a great deal of
moderation; when, though he proves that scripture psalms
should be preferred before all others, and more ordinarily
sung; yet he thinks that hymns of human composure, ought
not wholly to be excluded, provided they be exactly agreeable
to, and as much as may be, the words of holy scripture. There
are other writers whom I pay equal deference to, who have
concisely, though with a considerable degree of judgment,
proved singing to be a gospel-ordinance<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a>, who argue against
singing of <i>hymns</i>: and, indeed, what they say in opposition to
those who defend the practice thereof from Eph. v. 19. and
Col. iii. 16. wherein <i>hymns</i> are supposed to be distinct from
<i>psalms and spiritual songs</i>; and, consequently, that we are to
understand thereby human composures, agreeable to scripture,
as by psalms and spiritual songs, we are to understand those
which are contained in the very words of scripture, seems very
just. And herein they speak agreeably to the mind of several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>judicious and learned men, who assert that these three words
signify nothing else but those psalms or songs that are contained
in scripture<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a>. The question in debate with me, is not
whether the psalms, hymns, or spiritual songs, that are contained
in scripture, are designed to be a directory for gospel-worship;
for that, I think, all ought to allow; but, whether it
be lawful to sing a human composure that is agreeable to
scripture, either as to the words or sense thereof; especially
when the subject-matter of our praise is not laid down so
largely in one particular section of scripture, as we desire to
express it. In this case, if we were to connect several parts
of scripture together, so that the design of enlarging on a particular
subject might be answered thereby; it would render it
less necessary to compose an hymn in other words. But, inasmuch
as the occasions of praise are very large and extensive,
and therefore it may be thought expedient, to adore the divine
perfections, in our own words in singing, in like manner as we
do in prayer, considering the one to be a moral duty as well
as the other; I will not pretend to maintain the unlawfulness
of singing hymns of human composure, though some of much
superior learning and judgment have done it.</p>

<p class='c006'>I would, however, always pay the greatest deference to
those divine composures, which are given as the principal rule
for our procedure herein. Nevertheless, I cannot but express
my dislike of several hymns that I have often heard sung; in
some of which the heads of the sermon have been comprised;
and others, which are printed, are so very mean and injudicious,
and, it may be, in some respects, not very agreeable to
the analogy of faith, that I cannot, in the least, approve of
them. But if we have ground to conclude the composure, as
to the matter thereof, and mode of expression, unexceptionable,
and adapted to raise the affections, as well as excite suitable
acts of faith in extolling the praises of God, it gives me
no more disgust, though it be not in scripture-words, than
praying or preaching do when the matter is agreeable thereunto.
Yet, inasmuch as when we confess sin, acknowledge
mercies received, or desire those blessings that are suited to
our case, we always suppose, that the words, which he, who
is the mouth of the congregation, uses, ought to be such, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>which all can join with him (and in this, the reading one of
David’s prayers, and putting up a prayer in the congregation,
differ as to a very considerable circumstance in each of them)
the same ought to be observed in hymns. But, if an <i>hymn</i> be
so composed, as that all that sing it are represented as signifying
their having experienced those things which belong not
to them, or as blessing God for what they never received:
this, I conceive, would be an unwarrantable method of singing
hymns of human composure, as much as if the expressions
were used in public prayer. There are, indeed, many hymns
which have in them a great vein of piety and devotion, but
are not adapted to the experience of the whole assembly that
sings them; therefore, though they may join in signing some
hymns, I do not think they can well join in singing all; notwithstanding
the subject-matter of them may be agreeable to
the analogy of faith; and this principally depends upon what
we have before laid down, concerning the difference between
making use of a divine and human composure, in the former
of which, the words are not always to be considered as our
own, or expressive of the frame of our own spirits; whereas
this is universally true, with respect to the latter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus concerning the ordinance of singing; which we cannot
but think included among those whereby Christ communicates
to his church, the benefits of his mediation. And this leads
us to consider the other ordinances, which are particularly insisted
on in the remaining part of this work. And that which
next comes under our consideration, is the word read and
preached.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLV.</span> <i>How is the word made effectual to salvation?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The Spirit of God maketh the reading, but especially
the preaching of the word, an effectual means of enlightening,
convincing, and humbling sinners, of driving them out
of themselves, and drawing them unto Christ, of conforming
them to his image, and subduing them to his will, of
strengthening them against temptations and corruptions, of
building them up in grace, and establishing their heart in
holiness and comfort through faith unto salvation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having had an account, in the foregoing answer, of the
ordinances by which Christ communicates the benefits of
redemption to his church, and what they are; as also, that
singing the praises of God is one of those ordinances. We
are now to consider another ordinance that is made effectual
to salvation, <i>viz.</i> the word read, or preached. We have, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>some foregoing answers, had occasion to speak of the
word of God as contained in the scriptures of the Old and
New Testament, and considered it as the only rule of faith
and obedience, and as having all the properties that are necessary
thereunto, so that we may depend upon it as a perfect
and infallible revelation of all things necessary to be believed
and done, in order to our enjoying God here, and attaining
eternal life hereafter<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a>. And now we are to consider the word
as made the subject of our study and enquiry; without which
it would be of no use to us. Accordingly we may observe in
this answer,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Something supposed; namely, that the word of God is to
be read by us, and explained by those who are qualified and
called hereunto, by whom it is to be preached. We are not,
indeed, to conclude, that the explications of fallible men, how
much soever they are fitted to preach the gospel, are of equal
authority with the sacred oracles, as transmitted to us by those
who received them, by infallible inspiration from the Spirit of
God; and therefore, the text is much more to be depended on
than the comment upon it; the truth whereof is to be tried
thereby, Isa. viii. 20. 1 Thess. v. 21. Acts xvii. 11. Nevertheless,
this is to be reckoned a great blessing, which God is
pleased to bestow upon his church, in order to our understanding
and making a right use of the written word. Accordingly,
preaching, as well as the reading of the word, is an
ordinance which the Spirit of God makes subservient to the
salvation of them that believe; and in order thereunto, it is
farther supposed, that the word is to be read by us, and we
are to attend to the preaching thereof; to neglect either of
which, is to despise our own souls, and deprive ourselves of
the advantage of God’s instituted means of grace. Therefore,
we are not to content ourselves, barely, with the reading of
the word of God, in our closets or families; but we must embrace
all opportunities, in which we may hear it preached in
a public manner, one being no less an ordinance of God than
the other.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> It is objected, by some, that they know as much as
ministers can teach them; at least, they know enough, if they
could but practise it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> This objection, sometimes, savours of pride and self-conceit,
in those who suppose themselves to understand more,
of the doctrines of the gospel, than they really do; and it can
hardly be said, concerning the greatest number of professors,
that they either know as much as they ought, or that it is not
possible for them to make advances in knowledge, by a diligent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>attendance on an able and faithful ministry. However,
that we may give the utmost scope to the objection, we will
allow, that some Christians know more than many ministers,
who are less skilful than others in the word of truth. Nevertheless,
it must be observed that there are other ends of hearing
the word, besides barely the gaining of knowledge, viz.
the bringing the doctrines of the gospel to our remembrance,
John xvi. 26. and their being impressed on our affections; and
for this reason the wisest and best of men have not thought it
below them, to attend upon the ministry of those who knew
less than themselves. Our Saviour was an hearer of the word
before he entered on his public ministry, Luke ii. 46. and
though it might, I think, truly be said of him, that though he
was but twelve years old, he knew more than the doctors, in
the midst of whom he sat, in the temple, yet he <i>heard and asked
them questions</i>. And David, though he professes himself
to have <i>more understanding than all his teachers</i>, Psal. cxix.
99. yet he was glad to embrace all opportunities, to go up
into the house of the Lord; this being God’s appointed means
for a believer’s making advances in grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. There are several things particularly mentioned in this
answer, in which the Spirit of God makes the word, read or
preached, effectual to salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Hereby the mind is enlightened and furnished with the
knowledge of divine truths, which is a very great privilege,
for as faith is inseparably connected with salvation; the knowledge
of the doctrines of the gospel is necessary to faith; and
this is said to <i>come by hearing</i>, Rom. x. 17. Acts viii. 30, 31.
However, we must not content ourselves with a bare assent
to what is revealed in the word of God; but must duly weigh
the tendency thereof, to our sanctification and consolation, and
admire the beauty, excellency, and glory that there is in the
great doctrines of the gospel, as the divine perfections shine
forth therein, to the utmost. We must also duly consider the
importance of those doctrines that are contained therein, and
how they are to be improved by us, to our spiritual advantage;
and when we find our hearts filled with love to Jesus
Christ, in proportion to those greater measures of light, that
he is pleased to impart to us, so that we grow in grace as well
as in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
2 Pet. iii. 18. then the word may be said to be made effectual
to our salvation, as our minds are very much enlightened and
improved in the knowledge of those things that lead thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The word is made effectual to bring us under conviction,
by which means we see ourselves sinful and miserable creatures;
particularly we are hereby led to see those depths of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>wickedness that are in our hearts, by nature, which otherwise
could not be sufficiently discerned by us, much less improved
to our spiritual advantage, Jer. xvii. 9. Rom. vii. 9. Would
we take a view of the manifold sins committed in our lives,
with all their respective aggravations, so as to lay to heart the
guilt that we have contracted hereby, or, if we would be effected
with the consideration of the misery that will ensue
hereupon; as that, hereby, we not only deserve the wrath and
curse of God, but without an interest in forgiving grace, are
bound to conclude ourselves liable to it: These things we are
led into by the word of God. And if we would know whether
these convictions of sin are such as have a more immediate
reference to salvation; let us enquire, whether they are
attended with that grief and sorrow of heart for the intrinsic
evil that there is in sin, as well as the sad consequences thereof?
Psal. xxxviii. 18. compared with ver. 4. or, whether,
when we have taken this view thereof, we are farther led to
enquire after the remedy, and seek forgiveness through the
blood of Christ, and strength against those corruptions that
we have ground to charge ourselves with, which have so much
prevailed over us? Acts xvi. 30. Psal. xix. 13. xxv. 11. Jer.
viii. 22.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The word is made effectual to salvation, when what is
contained therein tends to humble and lay us low at the foot
of God; when we acknowledge, that all his judgments are
right, or whatever punishments have been inflicted, pursuant
to the threatenings which he has denounced, have been less
than our iniquities deserve, Ezra ix. 13. And when we receive
reproofs for sins committed, with a particular application
thereof to ourselves, and are sensible of the guilt we have
contracted thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that we may make a right use of the word, to answer
this great end, let us consider, what humbling considerations
are contained therein, that may have a tendency to answer this
end.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) The word of God represents to us that infinite distance
that there is between him and us; so that the best of creatures
are, in his sight, as nothing, Isa. xl. 17. <i>less than nothing, and
vanity</i>. Herein we behold God as infinitely perfect, and men
as very imperfect, and unlike to him; and in particular, we
behold him as a God of infinite holiness, spotless purity, and
ourselves as impure, polluted creatures; which is a very humbling
consideration, Prov. xxx. 2. Isa. lxiv. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The word of God discovers to us the deceitfulness and
desperate wickedness that there is in our hearts, whereby we
are naturally inclined to rebel against him; and should, had it
not been for his preventing and renewing grace, have run with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the vilest of men, in all excess of riot. It also leads us into
the knowledge of the various kinds of sin, which we have
ground to charge ourselves with, in the course of our lives;
the frequent omission of those duties which are required of us;
our great neglect of relative duties, in the station in which
God has fixed us; and the injury we have done to others
hereby, whom we have caused to stumble, or fall by our example,
or, at least, by our unconcernedness about their spiritual
welfare. It also discovers to us the various aggravations of
sins committed, as they are against light, love, mercies, and
manifold engagements, which we are laid under; and the
great contempt which we have cast on the blessed Jesus, in
disregarding, or not improving, the benefits of his mediation.
All these things duly considered, have a tendency to humble
us, and we are led into the discovery hereof by the word of
God.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The word of God is made effectual to salvation, as it has
a tendency to drive sinners out of themselves, and to draw
them to Jesus Christ. On the one hand, it shews them the
utter impossibility of their saving themselves, by doing any
thing that may bring them into a justified state, and so render
them accepted in the sight of God; and, on the other hand, it
draws or leads them to Christ, whom they are enabled to behold
by faith, as discovered in the gospel, to be a merciful and
all-sufficient Saviour. The former of these is not only antecedent,
but necessary to the latter: For, so long as we fancy that
we have a sufficiency in ourselves, to recommend us to God,
and procure for us a right and title to eternal life, we shall never
think of committing our souls into Christ’s hand, in order
to our obtaining salvation from him in his own way. Thus
the prophet brings in a self-conceited people as saying, <i>We are
lords, we will come no more to thee</i>, Jer. ii. 31. No one will
seek help or safety from Christ, who is not sensible of his own
weakness, and being in the utmost danger without him. The
first thing then that the Spirit of God does in the souls of men,
when he makes the word effectual to salvation, is, his leading
them into a humble sense of their utter inability to do what is
spiritually good, or acceptable to God, or to make atonement
for the sins that they have committed against him; that so they
might be brought into a justified state. It is, indeed, an hard
matter to convince the sinner of this; for he is very prone to
be full of himself, sometimes to glory with the Pharisee, Luke
xviii. 11. in some religious duties he performs; at other times
in his abstaining from those gross enormities that others are
chargeable with: Or, if he will own himself to have exceeded
many in sin; yet he is ready to think, that, by some expedient
or other, he shall be able to make atonement for it. This sets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>him at a great distance from Christ; as it is said, <i>They that
be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick</i>, Matt. ix.
12. So these do not see their need of a Saviour, till they are
convinced that they have nothing in themselves that can afford
any relief to them, so as to deliver them from the guilt of sin,
and the misery that will ensue thereupon. On this account our
Saviour observes, that <i>publicans and harlots go into the kingdom
of God</i>, chap. xxi. 31. <i>i. e.</i> are more easily made sensible
of their need of Christ, being convinced of sin, when the <i>chief
priests and elders</i>, who thought they had a righteousness of
their own to justify them, and therefore refused to comply with
the method of the gospel, in having recourse to Christ alone
for this privilege.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the word of God is made use of by the Spirit, to drive
the sinner out of these strong holds, and to shew him that he
cannot, by any means recover himself out of that state of sin
and misery, into which he is plunged. It is a very hard thing
for a person to be convinced of the truth of what our Saviour
says, viz. <i>That which is highly esteemed amongst men, is an
abomination in the sight of God</i>, Luke xvi. 15. when it is put
in the room of Christ and his righteousness. This is one of
the great ends to which the word is made subservient when
rendered effectual to salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, the word of God draws the soul to Christ, so that
it is persuaded and induced, from gospel-motives, to come to
him; and, at the same time, enabled so to do by the almighty
power of God, without which he cannot come to him, John
vi. 44. the former draws objectively, the latter subjectively and
internally.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what the gospel does in order hereunto, let it be considered,
that it sets before us the excellency and glory of Christ,
as our great Mediator; represents him as a divine person, and,
consequently, the object of faith, and as such, <i>able to save, to
the uttermost, them that come unto God by him</i>, Heb. vi. 25.
It considers him as having purchased salvation for his people;
so that they may obtain forgiveness through his blood. It also
discovers him as not only able, but willing to save all that
come to him by faith; so that he will in no wise cast them out,
John vi. 37. It also represents him as having a right to us;
we are his by purchase; and therefore it is our indispensible
duty to give up ourselves unto him. It also makes known to
us the greatness of his love, as the highest inducement hereunto;
the freeness, riches and extensiveness of his grace, as ready
to embrace the chief of sinners, and pass by all the injuries
that they have done against him, and as giving them the utmost
assurance, that, having loved them in the world, he will
love them to the end. Thus Christ is set forth in the gospel;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and when it is made effectual to salvation, the soul is induced,
or, as it were, constrained hereby, to love him, and yield the
obedience of faith unto him in all things.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. The word is made of use by the Spirit, as a means to
conform the soul to the image of God, and subdue it to his
will. The image of God in man, is defaced by sin; so that
he is not only rendered unlike, but averse to him, stripped of
all his beauty, and become abominable and filthy in his sight;
and, as long as he remains so, is unmeet for communion with,
or obtaining salvation from him. Now, when the Spirit of
God communicates special grace to sinners, he instamps this
image afresh upon the soul, which he renews in knowledge,
righteousness, and holiness, sanctifies all the powers and faculties
thereof, and subdues the will, so that it yields a cheerful
obedience to the will of God, and delights in his law after the
inward man; and its language is, <i>Speak, Lord, for thy servant
heareth</i>. This change the Spirit of God works in the heart,
by his internal efficacious influence; as has been formerly observed,
when we considered the work of conversion and sanctification,
as brought about by him<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a>. And this effect is also
ascribed to the word as a moral instrument thereof; so that it
is not attained without it, it being, indeed, the principal end of
the preaching the gospel; as the apostle says, <i>The weapons of
our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling
down of strong holds, casting down imaginations, and every
high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God</i>, 2
Cor. x. 4, 5. and bringing into captivity every thought to the
obedience of Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. The word is farther said to be made effectual to salvation,
as hereby we are strengthened against temptation, and corruption.
By the former, those objects are presented to us that
have a tendency to alienate our affections from God; by the
latter, these temptations are complied with, and the affections
entangled in the snare that is laid for them, Satan, or the world,
present the bait, and corrupt nature is easily allured and taken
by it. The tempter uses many wiles and stratagems to ensnare
us, and our own hearts are deceitful above all things, and without
much difficulty, turned aside thereby; and so led captive
by Satan at his will. But when the Spirit of God makes the
word effectual to salvation, he takes occasion hereby to detect
the fallacy; lays open the design of our spiritual enemies, and
the pernicious tendency thereof; and internally fortifies the
soul against them, whereby it is <i>kept from the paths of the destroyer</i>,
Psal. xvii. 4. and this he does by presenting other and
better objects to engage our affections, and leading us into the
knowledge of those glorious truths, that may prevent a sinful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>compliance with the solicitations of the devil. And, according
to the nature of the temptation that may occur, we are directed
to the precepts or promises contained in the word of
God; which, being duly improved by us, have a tendency to
keep the heart steady, and fixed in the ways of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. The word of God is made effectual by the Spirit, as he
thereby builds the soul up in grace, and establishes it in holiness
and comfort, through faith unto salvation. The work of
grace is not immediately brought to perfection, but is, in a
progressive way, making advances towards it; and therefore
we are first made holy by the renovation of our hearts and lives,
and made partakers of those spiritual consolations that accompany
or flow from the work of sanctification; and then we are
built up in holiness and comfort, whereby we go from strength
to strength, and are more and more established in the ways of
God; and this is done by the preaching of the word, whereby
we are said to <i>grow in grace, and the knowledge of our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ</i>, 2 Pet. iii. 18. so that every step we
take in our way to heaven, from the time that our faces are first
turned towards it, we are enabled hereby to go on safely and
comfortably, till the work of grace is perfected in glory.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLVI., CLVII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLVI.</span> <i>Is the word of God to be read by all?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Although all are not to be permitted to read the word
publicly to the congregation, yet all sorts of people are bound
to read it apart by themselves, and with their families, to
which end the holy scriptures are to be translated out of the
original, into vulgar languages.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLVII.</span> <i>How is the word of God to be read?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The holy scriptures are to be read, with an high and
reverend esteem of them; with a firm persuasion that they
are the very word of God, and that he only can enable us to
understand them, with desire to know, believe, and obey the
will of God revealed in them, with diligence and attention
to the matter and scope of them; with meditation, application,
self-denial, and prayer.</p>

<p class='c011'>The word’s being made effectual to salvation, which was
the subject last insisted on, not only supposes that we
read it as translated into vulgar languages, but that we understand
what we read, in order to our applying it to our particular
case, and improving it for our spiritual advantage. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>things are next to be considered as contained in the answers
we are now to explain. Accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. We have an account, in the former of them, of the obligation
that all persons are under to read, or at least, attend to
the reading of the word of God; more particularly,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. It is to be read publicly in the congregation, by those who
are appointed for that purpose. This is evident, inasmuch as
the church, and all the public worship that is performed therein,
is founded on the doctrines contained in scripture; and
every one who would be made wise to salvation, ought to be
well acquainted with it; and the reading it publicly, as a part
of that worship that is performed in the church, is not only a
testimony of the high esteem that we have for it; but it will
be of great use to those, who, through a sinful neglect to read
it in families, and their not being disposed to do this in their
private retirement; or, through the stupidity of their hearts,
and the many incumbrances of worldly business, will not allow
themselves time for this necessary duty, by reason whereof
they remain strangers to those great and important truths contained
therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>That this is a duty appears from the charge that the apostle
gives, that the epistle which he wrote to the church at Thessalonica,
should <i>be read unto all the holy brethren</i>, 1 Thess. v.
27. And he gives the like charge to the church at Colosse,
Col. iv. 16. And to this we may add, that the scripture is not
only to be read, but explained; which is the principal design
of the preaching thereof. This is no new practice; for the Old
Testament was not only read, but explained in the synagogues
<i>every Sabbath-day</i>; which is called, by a metonymy, a <i>reading
Moses</i>, Acts xv. 21. <i>viz.</i> explaining the law that was given
by him. Thus Ezra <i>stood upon a pulpit of wood, opened the
book in the sight of all the people</i>; and he, with some other of
his brethren that assisted him herein, <i>read in the book in the
law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to
understand the reading</i>, that is, the meaning thereof, Neh. viii.
4,-8. In like manner our Saviour <i>went into the synagogue
the Sabbath-day</i>, and <i>stood up</i> and <i>read</i>, that part of the holy
scriptures, taken from the prophecy of Isaiah; which, when he
had done, he applied it to himself, and shewed them how <i>it
was fulfilled in their ears</i>, Luke iv. 16,-24. So that it is
supposed that the word is to be publicly read.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only thing in this answer, that needs explaining is, what
is meant by those words, all are not to be permitted to read
the word publicly to the congregation. We are not to suppose
that there is an order of men that Christ has appointed to be
readers in the church, distinct from ministers; therefore the
meaning of this expression may be, that all are not to read the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>word of God together, in a public assembly, with a loud voice;
for that would tend rather to confusion than edification. Nor
ought any to be appointed to do it, but such as are grave, pious,
and able to read it distinctly, for the edification of others.
And who is so fit for this work, as the minister whose office is
not only to read, but explain it in the ordinary course of his
ministry?</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The word of God is to be read in our families; which
is absolutely necessary for the propagating religion therein.
This, indeed, is shamefully neglected; which is one great reason
of the ignorance and decay of piety in the rising generation;
and the neglect hereof is contrary to God’s command,
Deut. vi. 6, 7. as well as the example of those who are highly
commended for this practice; as Abraham was for <i>commanding
his children, and his household after him, that they should
keep the way of the Lord</i>, Gen. xviii. 19. Psal. lxxviii. 3, 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The word of God ought to be read by every one, in private;
and that not only occasionally, but frequently as one of
the great businesses of life. Thus God says to Joshua, Josh.
i. 8. <i>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth;
but thou shalt meditate therein day and night</i>, Psal. i. 2. And
our Saviour commands the Jews to <i>search the scriptures</i>, John
v. 39. and, in some of his discourses with them, though he
was sensible that they were a degenerate people; yet he takes
it for granted, that they had not altogether laid aside this duty,
Matt. xii. 5. chap. xxi. 42. Luke vi. 3. This practice, especially
where the word of God has not only been read, but the
meaning thereof sought after, and attended to with great diligence,
is commended as a peculiar excellency in Christians,
who are, in this respect, styled more <i>noble</i> than others, who
are defective in this duty, Acts xvii. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now it appears, that it is the duty of every one to read the
word of God, inasmuch as it is given us with this design. If
God is pleased, as it were, to send us an epistle from heaven,
it is a very great instance of contempt cast on it, as well as on
the divine condescension expressed therein, for us to neglect
to read it. Does he impart his mind to us herein, and is it
not our indispensable duty, to pay the utmost regard thereto?
Rev. i. 11. compared with chap. ii. 29. Moreover, our own
advantage should be a farther inducement to us, to read the
word of God; since his design in giving it, was, that we might
believe, and that believing, we may attain life, through the
name of Christ, John xx. 31. Rom. x. 17. chap. xv. 4. It is
sometimes compared to a <i>sword</i>, for our defence, against our
spiritual enemies, Eph. vi. 17. and is therefore designed for
use; otherwise it is no advantage for us. It is elsewhere
compared to a <i>lamp to our feet</i>, Psal. cxix. 105. which is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>designed for an ornament, but to guide us in the right way;
therefore we must attend to its direction. It is also compared
to <i>food</i>, whereby we are said to be <i>nourished up in the words
of faith and good doctrine</i>, and <i>as new-born babes</i> we are exhorted,
to <i>desire the sincere milk of the word, that we may
grow thereby</i>, 1 Pet. ii. 2. but this end cannot be attained,
unless it be read and applied by us to our own necessities.</p>

<p class='c006'>This leads us to take notice of the opposition that the Papists
make hereunto, inasmuch as they deny the common people the
liberty of reading the scriptures in their own language, without
leave given them from the bishop, or some other spiritual
guides, who are authorized to allow or deny this privilege, as
they think fit; but without this, the reading of it is strictly
prohibited. And, as an instance of their opposition to it, they
have sometimes burnt whole impressions of the Bible, in the
open market-place; as well as expressed their contempt hereof,
by burning particular copies of scripture, or dragging them
through the streets, throwing them in the kennels, and stamping
them under feet, or tearing them in pieces, as though it
was the vilest book in the world; and some have been burned
for reading it. And, that it may be brought into the utmost
contempt, they have cast the most injurious reproaches upon
it, by calling it a bending rule, a nose of wax, a dumb judge.
And some have blasphemed it, by saying, that it has no more
authority than Esop’s fables; and have compared the psalms
of David to profane ballads. And, they pretend, by all this,
to consult the good of the people, that they may not be misled
thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which they generally allege in vindication of this practice,
is, that they do not so much oppose the reading the scripture,
as the reading those translations of it, which have been
made by Protestants; and that it is our Bible, not that which
they allow to be the word of God, that they treat with such
injurious contempt.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to this it may be replied; that the objections they bring
against scripture, are not taken so much from such passages
thereof, which they pretend to be falsely translated; but their
design is, plainly, to keep the people in ignorance, that they
may not, as the consequence of their reading it, imbibe those
doctrines, that will, as they pretend, turn them aside from the
faith of the church; and therefore, they usually maintain, that
the common people ought to be kept in ignorance, as an expedient
to excite devotion; and that, by this means, they will
be the more humble, and pay a greater deference to those unwritten
traditions that are propagated by them, and pretended
to be of equal authority with scripture, which the common
people must take up with instead of it. And, indeed, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>consequence hereof, is agreeable to their desire; for they appear
to be grossly ignorant, and think themselves bound to
believe whatever their leaders pretend to be true, without exercising
a judgment of discretion, or endeavouring to know
the mind of God relating thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which they generally allege in opposing the common
people’s reading the Bible, is, that it contains <i>some things</i> in
it that are <i>hard to be understood</i>; as the apostle Peter expresses
it, in 2 Pet. iii. 16. <i>which they that are unlearned and unstable
wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their destruction</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to this it may be replied; that it must be allowed that
some things contained in scripture, are hard to be understood;
inasmuch as the gospel contains some mysteries which finite
wisdom cannot comprehend; and the great doctrines of the
gospel, are sometimes unintelligible by us, by reason of the
ignorance and alienation of our minds from the life of God,
as well as from the imperfections of this present state, in which
we know but in part. Notwithstanding, they, who with diligence
and humility, desire, and earnestly seek after the knowledge
of those truths that are more immediately subservient to
their salvation, shall find that their labour is not lost; but in
following on to know the Lord, shall know as much of him as
is necessary to their glorifying and enjoying him, as the prophet
says, <i>Then shall ye know if ye follow on to know the
Lord</i>, Hos. vi. 3. It is to be owned, that there are some
depths in scripture, that cannot be fathomed by a finite understanding;
which should tend to raise our admiration, and put
us upon adoring the unsearchable wisdom of God, as well as
an humble confession that <i>we are but of yesterday, and know</i>,
comparatively, <i>nothing</i>, Job viii. 9. Yet there are many doctrines
that we may attain to a clear knowledge of, and improve,
to the glory of God, in the conduct of our lives. Thus the
prophet speaks of an <i>high way</i>, that is called <i>the way of holiness</i>;
concerning which it is said, that <i>way-faring men</i>, who
walk therein, <i>though fools</i>, that is, such as have the meanest
capacity, as to other things, <i>shall not err therein</i>, Isa. xxxv. 8.
that is, they who humbly desire the teaching of the Spirit,
whereby they may be made acquainted with the mind and will
of God, shall not be led out of the way by any thing that he
has revealed to his people in his word. It is very injurious
to the sacred oracles to infer, that because some things are
hard to be understood, therefore all that read them, must necessarily
wrest them to their own destruction. And besides,
the apostle does not say, that all do so, but only those who are
<i>unlearned and unstable</i>; <i>unlearned</i>, that is, altogether unacquainted
with the doctrines of the gospel, as not making them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the matter of their study and enquiry; and <i>unstable</i>, that is,
such as give way to scepticism, or they whose faith is not
built on the right foundation, but are inclined to turn aside
from the truth, with every wind of doctrine. This God’s people
may hope to be kept from, while they study the holy scriptures,
and earnestly desire to be made wise thereby unto salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what the Papists farther allege against the common
people’s being permitted to read the scriptures, because, as
they pretend, this will make them proud, and induce them to
enquire into those things that do not belong to them, whereby
they will soon think themselves wiser than their teachers; and
that it has been the occasion of all the heresies that are in the
world.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this it may be answered, that whatever ill consequences
attend a person’s reading of scripture, these are not to be ascribed
to the use, but the abuse of it. Will any one say, that
we ought to abstain from eating and drinking, because some
are guilty of excess therein, by gluttony and drunkenness?
No more ought we to abstain from reading the scriptures, because
some make a wrong use of them. But, inasmuch as it
is supposed that hereby some, through pride, will think themselves
wiser than their teachers; this, we will allow, they
may do, without passing a wrong judgment on themselves;
and it is injurious treatment of mankind, to keep the world in
ignorance, that they may not detect the fallacies, or expose
the errors of those who pretend to be their guides in matters
of faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what is farther alleged, that the reading of scripture
has been the occasion of many heresies in the world, I am
rather inclined to think, that this ought to be charged on the
neglect thereof, or, at least, on their not studying them with
diligence, and an humble dependence on God for his blessing
to attend it.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be observed, that whatever reasons are assigned for
their denying the people the liberty of reading the scriptures,
these seem to carry in them a pretence of great kindness to
them, that they may not, hereby, be led out of the way, and
do themselves hurt by this means; as it is a dangerous thing
to put a knife, or a sword, into a child’s, or madman’s hand;
by which they suppose the common people to be ignorant, and
would keep them so. But, whatever reasons they assign, the
true reason why they so much oppose the reading of scripture
is this, because it detects and exposes the absurdity of many
doctrines that are imbibed by them, which will not bear to be
tried by it. If they can but persuade their votaries, that
whatever is handed down by tradition, as a rule of faith, is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>be received, without the least hesitation, though contrary to
the mind of God in scripture, they are not like to meet with
any opposition from them, let them advance doctrines never
so absurd, or contrary to reason.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be enquired, whether they universally prohibit the reading
of scripture? It must be allowed, that the Vulgar Latin
version thereof may be read by any one that understands it,
without falling under their censure. But this they are sensible
of, that the greatest part of the common people cannot understand
it; and if they do, it is so corrupt a translation, that
it seems plainly calculated to give countenance to the errors
that they advance<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a>. So that it appears from their whole
management herein, that their design is to deprive mankind
of the greatest blessings which God has granted to them; and
to discourage persons from the performance of a duty, which
is so absolutely necessary to promote the interest of God and
religion in the world. Therefore we must conclude, that it is
an invaluable privilege that we are not only permitted, but
commanded to read the scriptures, as translated into that language
that is generally understood by us.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this leads us to consider the inference that is deduced
from hence, contained in the latter part of the answer which
we are explaining, <i>viz.</i> that the scriptures are to be translated
out of the original into vulgar languages. This is evident, inasmuch
as reading signifies nothing, where the words are not
understood; and every private Christian is not obliged to addict
himself to the study of the languages in which the scriptures
were written; and it is, indeed, a work of so much pains
and difficulty, that few have opportunity, or inclination, to
apply themselves, to any considerable purpose, to the study
thereof. Therefore, the words of scripture must be rendered
intelligible to all, and consequently, translated into a language
they understand.</p>

<p class='c006'>This may be argued from the care of providence, that the
scriptures should be delivered, at first, to the Jews, in their
own language; as the greatest part of the Old Testament was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>written in Hebrew, and those few sections or chapters in Ezra
and Daniel, that were written in the Chaldee language, were
not inserted till they understood that language<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a>. And, when
the world generally understood the Greek tongue, so that
there was no necessity for the common people to learn it in
schools, and the Hebrew was not understood by those nations,
for whom the gospel was designed; it pleased God to deliver
the New Testament in the Greek language. So that it is beyond
dispute that he intended, that the scriptures should not only be
read, but understood by the common people. And when the
gospel was sent to various nations of different languages, the
Spirit of God, by an extraordinary and miraculous dispensation,
furnished the apostles to speak to every one in their own
language, by bestowing on them the gift of tongues; which
would have been needless, if it were not necessary for persons
to read or hear the holy scriptures with understanding.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We are now to consider, how the word of God is to be
read, that we may understand, and improve what is contained
therein to our spiritual advantage; and in order thereunto,
there are several directions given in the latter of the answers
we are explaining.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. We must read the scriptures with an high and reverent
esteem of them, arising from a firm persuasion, that they are
the word of God. That they are so, has been proved by several
arguments<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a>; therefore we will suppose them that read
them, to be persuaded of the truth thereof; and this will beget
an high and reverent esteem of them. The perfections of
God, and particularly his wisdom, sovereignty, and goodness,
shine forth with equal glory in his word, as they do in any of
his works; and therefore it has a preference to all human composures;
in that whatever is revealed therein, is to be admired
and depended on for its unerring wisdom and infallible
verity; so that it is impossible for them, who understand and
improve it, to be turned aside thereby, from the way of truth.
We are also to consider the use that God makes of it, to propagate
his kingdom and interest in the world. It is by this
means that he convinces men of sin, and discovers to them the
way of obtaining forgiveness of it, and victory over it, and
thoroughly furnishes them unto every good work, 2 Tim. iii.
16. For this reason the wisest and best of men have expressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the highest esteem and value for it. The Psalmist mentions
the love he had to it, as a person that was in a rapture;
<i>O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day</i>, Psal.
cxix. 97. And elsewhere he speaks of it as <i>more to be desired
than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey
and the honey comb</i>, Psal. xix. 16. which argues the high veneration
he had for it. This we all ought to have; otherwise
we may sometimes be tempted to read it with prejudice, and
thereby, through the corruption of our nature, be prone to
cavil at it, as we sometimes do at those writings that are
merely human, which savour of the weakness and imperfection
of their authors, and consequently, it will be impossible for us
to receive any saving advantage thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We must, in reading the word of God, be sensible that
he alone can enable us to understand it. To read the scriptures
and not understand them, will be of no advantage to us;
therefore it is supposed, that we are endeavouring to have our
minds rightly informed and furnished with the knowledge of
divine truths: But by reason of the corruption, ignorance, and
depravity of our natures, this cannot be attained without a peculiar
blessing from God attending our endeavours; therefore
we ought to glorify him, by dependence on him, for this
privilege, (as being sensible that all spiritual wisdom is from
him,) if we would see a beauty and glory in those things that are
revealed therein, and be thoroughly established in the doctrines
of the gospel, so as not to be in danger of being turned aside
from them; or, especially, if we would improve them to our
being made wise unto salvation, we must consider this as the
gift of God. It is he alone who can enable us to understand
his word aright; this is evident, inasmuch as it is necessary
that there be an internal illumination, as well as an external
revelation, which is the subject-matter of our studies and enquiries.
Thus our Saviour not only repeated the words of
those scriptures that concerned himself, to the two disciples
going to Emmaus; but he <i>opened their understandings, that
they might understand them</i>, Luke xxiv. 45. Without this, a
person may have the brightest parts, and most penetrating
judgment in other respects, and yet be unacquainted with the
mind of God in his word, and inclined to embrace those doctrines
that are contrary to it; and especially if God is not
pleased to succeed our endeavours, we shall remain destitute
of the experimental knowledge of divine truths, which is absolutely
necessary to salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We must read the word of God with a desire to know,
believe, and obey his will, contained therein. If we do not desire
to know, or understand the meaning of scripture, it will
remain no better than a sealed book to us; and, instead of receiving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>thereby, we shall be ready to entertain prejudices against
it, till we lay it aside, with the utmost dislike; and, as
the consequence thereof, we shall be utterly estranged from the
life of God, through the ignorance and vanity of our minds.
We must also read the word of God with a desire to have our
faith established thereby, that our feet may be set upon a rock,
and we may be delivered from all manner of doubts and hesitations,
with respect to those important truths which are revealed
therein; and we ought to desire, not only to believe,
but yield a constant and cheerful obedience to every thing that
God requires of us therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Our reading the word of God ought to be accompanied
with meditation, and the exercise of self-denial. Our thoughts
should be wholly taken up with the subject-matter thereof, and
that with the greatest intenseness, as those who are studiously,
and with the greatest earnestness, pressing after the knowledge
of those doctrines that are of the highest importance, that
our profiting herein may appear to ourselves and others,
1 Tim. iv. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the exercise of self-denial, all those perverse reasonings
which our carnal minds are prone to suggest against the
subject-matter of divine revelation, are to be laid aside. If we
are resolved to believe nothing but what we can comprehend,
we ought to consider that the gospel contains unsearchable
mysteries, that surpass finite wisdom; therefore we must be
content to acknowledge, that we know but in part. There is a
deference to be paid to the wisdom of God, that eminently
appears in every thing which he has discovered to us in his
word; so that we must adore the divine perfections that are
displayed therein, whilst we retain an humble sense of the imperfection
of our own knowledge. Our reason is not to be
considered as useless; but we must desire that it may be
sanctified, and inclined to receive whatever God is pleased to
impart. We are also to exercise the grace of self-denial, with
respect to the obstinacy of our wills; whereby they are naturally
disinclined to acquiesce in, approve of, and yield obedience
to the law of God, so that we may be entirely satisfied,
that every thing that he commands in his word, is holy, just,
and good.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. The word of God is to be read with fervent prayer; as
the apostle says, <i>If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God,
that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall
be given him</i>, James i. 5. The advantage we expect hereby, is
as was before observed, his gift; and therefore we are humbly
to supplicate him for it. There are many things in his
word that are hard to be understood; therefore we ought to
say, whenever we take the scriptures into, our hands, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Psalmist does, <i>Open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous
things out of thy law</i>, Psal. cxix. 18. We may, in this case,
humbly acknowledge the weakness of our capacities and the
blindness of our minds, which renders it necessary for us to
desire to be instructed by him, in the way of truth. We
may also plead, that his design in giving us this word, was,
that it may be a lamp to our feet, and a light to our paths;
therefore we dread the thoughts of walking in darkness, when
there is such a clear discovery of those things which are so
glorious and necessary to be known. We may also plead,
that our Lord Jesus is revealed to his people as the prophet of
his church; and that whatever office he is invested with, he
delights to execute it, as his glory is concerned therein;
therefore we trust, and hope that he will lead us, by his
Spirit into his truth. We may also plead the impossibility
of our attaining the knowlege of divine things, without his assistance;
and how much it would redound to his glory, as well
as our own comfort and advantage, if he will be pleased to
lead us into the saving knowlege of the truth, as it is in
him: This we cannot but importunately desire, as being sensible
of the sad consequences of our being destitute of it;
inasmuch as we should remain in darkness, though favoured
with the light of the gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. The word of God is to be read with diligence and attention
to the matter and scope thereof. We have hitherto
been directed in this answer, to apply ourselves to the reading
of scripture, with that frame of spirit which becometh
Christians, who desire to know the mind and will of God
therein, viz. that we ought to have our minds disengaged
from those prejudices which would hinder our receiving any
advantage from it, and to exercise those graces that the nature
and importance of the duty requires; that we ought to
depend upon God, and address ourselves to him by faith and
prayer for the knowlege of those divine truths contained therein.
But, in this last head, we are led to speak of some other
methods conducive to our understanding the scriptures; which
are the effects of diligence and attendance to the sense of the
words thereof, and the scope and design of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>This being an useful head, I shall take occasion to enlarge
on it more than I have done on the former, and to add some
other things, which may serve as a farther means to direct us,
how we may read the scriptures with understanding. I might
here observe, that they who are well acquainted with the languages
in which they were written, and are able to make just
remarks on the words, phrases, and particles used therein,
some of which cannot be expressed in another language without
losing much of their native beauty and significancy, these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>have certainly the advantage of all others: But since this cannot
be done by the greatest part of mankind, who are strangers
to the Greek and Hebrew languages; they must have recourse
to some other helps for the attaining this valuable end. And
in order thereunto,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) It will be of great use for them to consult those expositions,
which we have of the whole, or some particular parts of
scripture; of which some are more large, others concise; some
critical, others practical. I shall forbear making any remarks
tending to depreciate the performance of some, or extol the
judgment of others; only this must be observed, that many
have passed over some difficulties of scripture, which omission
has given a degree of disgust to the more inquisitive part of
Christians: But this may be attributed in some instances, to a
commendable modesty, which we find not only in those that
have written in our own, but in other languages; whereby
they tacitly confess, either that they could not solve the difficulty;
or, that it was better to leave it undetermined, than to
attempt a solution, which, at best, would amount to little
more than a probable conjecture. It may also be observed,
that others, who have commented on scripture, seem to be
prepossessed with a particular scheme of doctrine, which, if
duly considered, is not very defensible; and they are obliged,
sometimes, to strain the sense thereof, that it may appear to
speak agreeably to their own sentiments; however, their expositions,
in other respects, may be used with great advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this we may add, that the word preached, being designed
to lead us into the knowledge of scripture-doctrines, we ought
to attend upon, and improve it, as a means conducive thereto,
and to bless God for the great helps and advantages we have
to attain it; but more of this will be considered under some
following answers relating to the preaching and hearing the
word:<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a> therefore we proceed to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) That we ought to make the best use we can of those
translations of scripture, that we have in our own language;
which, if we compare together, we shall find, not only that the
style in which one is written, differs from that of another,
agreeably to the respective times in which they were written;
but they differ very much in the sense they give of many places
of scripture; which may easily be accounted for from the
various acceptations of the same Hebrew or Greek word, as
may be observed in all other languages; and there are other
difficulties relating to the propriety of translating some particular
phrases, or the various senses in which several particles
made use of, are to be understood. However, by comparing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>these translations together, they who are unacquainted with the
original, will be sometimes led into a sense more agreeable to
the context and the analogy of faith, by one of them, than by
another. But we will suppose the English reader to confine
himself to the translation that is generally used by us; which,
as it cannot be supposed to be of equal authority with the original,
nor yet so perfect, as that it is impossible to be corrected,
as to every word or phrase contained therein; yet I would be
far from taking occasion from hence to depreciate it, or say
any thing that may stagger the faith of any, as though we
were in danger of being led aside thereby, from the way of
truth, as some have pretended, who plead for the necessity of
a new translation of the Bible; whereas it is much to be feared,
that if any such thing should be attempted, it would deviate
more from the sense of the Holy Ghost, than that which
we now have, and have reason to bless God for, which, I
cannot but think, comes as near the original as most that are
extant. We shall therefore consider how this may be used to
the best advantage, for our understanding the mind of God
therein. And here we shall observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That there is another translation of words referred to
in the margin of our Bibles; which will sometimes give very
great light to the sense of the text, and appear more emphatical,
and rather to be acquiesced in. I shall give a short specimen
of some texts of scripture, that may be illustrated this
way; in which the marginal reading differs from the words it
refers to: Thus it is said, in Job iv. 18. <i>He put no trust in
his servants, and his angels he charged folly</i>: In the margin,
it is observed, that the words may be read, <i>He put no
trust in his servants, nor in his angels in whom he put light</i>;
which denotes the excellency of their nature, and the wisdom
with which they are endowed: Nevertheless, God put no trust
in them, not having thought fit to make use of them in creating
the world, nor committing the government thereof to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in Isaiah liii. 3. it is said, <i>We hid, as it were, our
faces from him</i>, speaking of our Saviour; but in the margin,
it is, <i>He hid, as it were, his face from us</i>; which implies, that,
as he bore our grief, so he was charged with our guilt; and
accordingly is represented, as having his face covered, as an
emblem hereof; or else it denotes his concealing or veiling
his glory, as he, who was really in the form of God, appeared
in the form of a servant.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in Jer. xlii. 20. the prophet reproving the people,
says, <i>Ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the
Lord your God, saying, Pray for us</i>; but, in the margin, it is,
<i>You have used deceit against your souls</i>; which contains a farther
illustration of the sense of the words; as it not only denotes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>their hypocrisy, but the consequence thereof, to wit, their
destruction; which agrees very well with the threatning denounced
in verse 22. that they should <i>die by the sword, the famine,
and by the pestilence</i>. And the same prophet in chap. x.
14. speaking of idolaters, says, <i>Every man is brutish in his
knowlege</i>; but in the margin it is, <i>Every man is more brutish
than to know</i>; in which their stupidity is rather assigned to
their ignorance than their knowlege.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in Zechariah xii. 5. it is said in the text, <i>The governors
of Judah shall say in their hearts, The inhabitants of Jerusalem
shall be my strength in the Lord of hosts their God</i>; but
in the margin it is, <i>The governors of Judah shall say, There is
strength to me, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, in the Lord
of hosts</i>; and this reading seems more agreeable to what follows;
which contains several promises of deliverance and
salvation, which God would work for the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
So that we are not to suppose them saying, <i>Jerusalem
shall be our strength</i>; but, the <i>Lord of hosts</i>, who is a safe-guard
to it, as well as to the governors of Judah.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in Acts xvii. 23. it is said in the text, <i>As I passed by,
and beheld your devotions</i>; but, in the margin it is, <i>The gods
whom you worship</i>, or, the things ye pay divine honour to;
which is very agreeable to the context, and the design of
the apostle therein. Again, in chap. xxii. 29. it is said in
the text, <i>that they departed from him, which should have examined
him</i>, meaning Paul, in the margin it is, <i>tortured him</i>;
which is agreeable to the Roman custom of scourging, and
thereby tormenting one that was under examination for supposed
crimes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in Gal. i. 14. the apostle says, <i>I profited in the
Jews religion, above many my equals</i>; in the margin it is, <i>My
equals in years</i>; which seems much more agreeable to the
apostle’s design.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in Heb. ii. 7. it is said in the text, <i>Thou madest
him</i>, viz. our Saviour, <i>a little lower than the angels</i>; in the
margin it is, <i>A little while inferior to them</i>; as referring to
his state of humiliation; which continued comparatively, but
a little while.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] In order to our making a right use of our English
translation, that we may understand the mind of God contained
therein, let it be farther observed, that by reason of the
conciseness of the Hebrew and Greek texts, there are several
words left out, which must be supplied, to complete the sense
thereof; which are inserted in an <i>Italic</i> character. And it
will not be difficult for us to determine whether the insertion
be just or no; when we consider that the translators
often take their direction herein from some words, either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>expressed or understood in the context; as in Heb. viii. 7. it
is said, <i>If the first</i> covenant <i>had been faultless</i>, &amp;c. where the
word <i>covenant</i> is inserted; as it is also in verse 13. because it
is expressly mentioned, in verses 8, 9, 10.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in chap. x. 6. it is said, in <i>sacrifices for sin thou
hadst no pleasure</i>. The word <i>sacrifices</i> is supplied from the
foregoing verse; and, for the same reason, <i>offerings</i> might as
well have been supplied, as in ver. 8. And, in ver. 25. we
are commanded to <i>exhort one another</i>; where <i>one another</i> is
supplied from the foregoing verse.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in 1 Pet. iv. 16. it is said, <i>If any man suffer as a
Christian, let him not be ashamed</i>; where the words, <i>any man
suffer</i>, are inserted as agreeable to what is mentioned, ver. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, in Eph. ii. 1. <i>You hath he quickened who were dead in
trespasses and sins</i>; the words, <i>hath he quickened</i>, are supplied
from ver. 5. and our translators might as well have added,
<i>you hath he quickened together with him</i>, viz. Christ. These
things I only mention as a specimen of the insertions, to complete
the sense in our translation; and we shall find, that the
words supplied in other scriptures, are for the most part, sufficiently
just; but if they be not so, they are subject to correction,
without the least imputation of altering the words of
scripture, while we are endeavouring to give the true sense
thereof; and we may be allowed, without perverting of the
sacred writings, sometimes, to supply other words instead of
them, which may seem more agreeable to the mind of the
Holy Ghost therein. Thus, in Eph. vi. 12. it is said, <i>We
wrestle against spiritual wickedness in high places</i>. The word
<i>places</i>, is supplied by our translators; and, in the margin, it is
observed, that it might as well be rendered <i>heavenly places</i>.
Now because there is no spiritual wickedness in heavenly
places, therefore they choose, without regard to the proper
sense of the Greek word, to render it <i>high places</i>. Whereas,
in chap. iii. 10. where there is no appearance of such an objection,
they render the same word, <i>heavenly places</i>; though,
I think, the words in both those scriptures, might better be
rendered <i>in what concerns heavenly things</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in 2 Cor. vi. 1. it is said, <i>We, as workers together
with him, beseech you</i>, &amp;c. where, <i>with him</i>, is supplied to
complete the sense; but, I think, it might better have been
left out, and then the sense would have been, ministers, are
<i>workers together with one another</i>, and not <i>together with God</i>;
they are honoured to be employed by God, as moral instruments,
which he makes use of; but they have no other casuality
in bringing about the work of grace. The principal reason
why the words <i>with him</i>, are supplied, is because it seems
agreeable to the apostle’s mode of speaking, in 1 Cor. iii. 9.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span><i>We are workers together with God</i>; but, I think, those words
might better be rendered, <i>labourers together of God</i><a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a>; or we
are jointly engaged in his work; therefore there is no reason
from hence to supply the words <i>with him</i>, in the text but now
referred to.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) If we would understand the sense of a particular text
of scripture, we must consider its connexion with the context.
Accordingly we must observe,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, The scope, design, or argument insisted on, in the paragraph,
in which it is contained. Thus in Rom. viii. the apostle’s
design in general, is to prove that there is <i>no condemnation
to them which are in Christ Jesus</i>, and to shew who they
are, that may conclude themselves to be interested in this privilege;
together with the many blessings that are connected
with, or flow from it, which the subject matter of that chapter
principally relates to.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, in Heb. i. the apostle’s principal design is, to prove
the excellency and glory of Christ, as Mediator, above the
angels, as he intimates ver. 4. which argument is principally
insisted on, and illustrated, in the following part of the chapter.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, in chap. xi. his design is, to give an account of the
great things the Old Testament church were enabled to do,
and suffer, by faith, of which, there is an induction of particulars
in several parts of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, in Rom. v. the apostle insists on the doctrine of original
sin, and shews how sin and death first entered into the
world, and by what means we may expect to be delivered
from it; and so takes occasion to compare Adam and Christ
together, as two distinct heads and representatives of those
who were included in the respective covenants which mankind
were under; by the former of which, sin reigned unto death,
and, by the latter, grace and righteousness, unto eternal life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in chap. vii. especially from ver. 5. the general argument
insisted on, is, the conflict and opposition there is between
sin and grace, and the manner in which corrupt nature
discovers itself in the souls of the regenerate, together with
the disturbance and uneasiness that it constantly gives them.
And, in Psal. lxxxviii. we have an account of the distress that
a soul is in, when under divine desertion, and brought to the
very brink of despair. And, in Psal. lxxii. under the type of
the glory of Solomon’s kingdom, and the advantages his subjects
should receive thereby, the glory and excellency of
Christ’s kingdom is illustrated, together with the gospel-state,
and blessings thereof. And, in Psal. li. David represents a
true penitent as addressing himself to God for forgiveness;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>though particularly applied to his own case, after he had sinned
in the matter of Uriah. Again, the general argument in
Isa. liii. is to set forth the sufferings of Christ, whereby he
made satisfaction for sin, together with the glory redounding
to himself, and the advantages that believers derive from it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, We must consider the method made use of in managing
the argument; whether by a close way of reasoning and
consequences deduced from premises, or, by an explication of
what was designed to inform the judgment, and laid down before
in a general proposition. Or, whether the principal design
of the paragraph be, to regulate the conduct of our lives,
awaken our consciences out of a stupid frame, or excite in us
becoming affections, agreeable to the subject-matter thereof.
And, we are to observe how every part of it is adapted to
answer these ends.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, We are to consider who is the person speaking, or
spoken to; whether they are the words of God, the church, or
the inspired writer; and, whether they are directed to particular
persons, or to all men in general? Here we may often observe,
that in the same paragraph there is an <i>apostrophe</i>, or
turning the discourse from one person to another. Nothing is
more common than this in the poetical writings of scripture.
Thus, in the Psalms of David, sometimes God is represented
as speaking to man, and then man as speaking to, or concerning
God, as we may observe, in Psal. cxxxvii. 1-4. there is
a relation of the church’s troubles in Babylon; and, in verses
5 and 6. the Psalmist addresses his discourse to the church;
<i>If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
cunning</i>. And, in ver. 7. he speaks to God, praying that he
would <i>remember the children of Edom, in the day of Jerusalem;
who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof</i>.
And, in ver. 8, 9. he turns his discourse to Babylon, as a
nation destined to destruction.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in Psal. ii. he speaks concerning the <i>rage</i> of the
<i>Heathen</i>, against Christ and his church, and that disappointment
and ruin that they should meet with for it. And, in
ver. 6. he represents God the Father as speaking concerning
Christ; <i>yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion</i>.
And, in ver. 7, 8. Christ is brought in as speaking or making
mention of the <i>decree</i> of God relating to his character and
office, as Mediator, and the success of his kingdom, as extended
to the <i>uttermost parts of the earth</i>, pursuant to his intercession,
which was founded on his satisfaction. And, in ver. 10-12,
the Psalmist turns his discourse to those persecuting
powers, or the kings of the earth, whom he had spoken of in
the former part of the Psalm, and instructs them what methods
they should take to escape God’s righteous vengeance. Such-like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>change of persons speaking, or spoken to, may be observed
in many of the Psalms, Psal. xvi. 1, <i>&amp;c.</i> and cxxxiv.</p>

<p class='c006'>And throughout the whole book of Canticles, there is an
inter-changeable discourse between Christ and his church,
which is sometimes called his <i>spouse</i>, at other times his <i>sister</i>;
sometimes he speaks to the church, and at other times of it.
And, in other places, the church is represented as speaking to
him, or to the <i>daughters of Jerusalem</i>, namely, those professors
of religion, that had little more than a form of godliness.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Again, we often find, that there is a change with respect to
the persons speaking, spoken to, or of, in the writings of the
prophets, as well as in the poetical writings; as may be observed
in Isa. lxiii. throughout the whole chapter. And, in Micah
vii. 18, 19, 20. there is a change of persons in almost every
sentence; <i>Who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity</i>,
&amp;c. <i>He retaineth not his anger for ever; he will subdue our
iniquities; and thou wilt cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.
Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham,
which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, We are farther to consider the occasion of what is
laid down in any chapter, paragraph, or book of scripture,
which we desire to understand. Thus the particular occasion
of the book of Lamentations, was the approaching ruin of Judah,
and the miseries that they should be exposed to when
Jerusalem was besieged by the Chaldeans; as appears by the
subject-matter thereof; though, it may be, that which was the
more immediate occasion of its being delivered at that time,
was, that the prophet might lament the death of good Josiah,
2 Chron. xxxv. 25. which, probably, he had a peculiar eye to,
when he says, <i>The crown is fallen from our head</i>, Lam. v. 16.
as well as the destruction of the whole nation, which would
ensue soon after it, in which their civil and religious liberties
would be invaded by their enemies, who would oppress and
lead them captive.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the principal occasion of the apostle’s writing the epistle
to the Galatians, was, that he might establish some among
them, in the faith of the gospel, who were so much disposed
to turn aside from him that called them, and embrace another
scheme of religion that was subversive of it; as he observes,
in chap. i. 6. where, by this <i>other gospel</i>, which he dissuades
them from turning aside unto, we are to understand those
doctrines that they had imbibed from those false teachers who
endeavour either to re-establish the observation of the ceremonial
law, or to put them upon seeking righteousness and
life, from their observing the precepts of the moral law, which
tended to overthrow the doctrine of justification by Christ’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>righteousness; which is a subject often insisted on by the
apostle, both in this and his other epistles.</p>

<p class='c006'>This method of enquiring into the occasion of what is mentioned
in particular paragraphs of scripture, will often give
light to some things contained therein. Thus we read, in
Matt. xxi. 23-27. that the <i>chief priests and elders</i> ask our
Saviour this question, <i>By what authority dost thou these things?</i>
which, had it proceeded from an humble mind, desirous to be
convinced by his reply to it; or, had he not often, in their
hearing, asserted the authority by which he did those things,
he would, doubtless, have told them, that he received a commission
to do them from the Father; and, that every miracle which
he wrought, was, as it were, a confirming seal annexed to it.
But our Saviour, knowing the design of the question, and the
character of the persons that asked it, he does not think fit to
make any reply to it, rather chusing to put them to silence, by
proposing another question to them, which he knew they would
not be forward to answer, relating to the baptism of John, <i>viz.</i>
whether it was <i>from heaven</i>, or <i>of men</i>. And this was certainly
the best method he could have taken; for he dealt with
them as cavillers, who were to be put to silence, and made
ashamed at the same time.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) In order to our understanding the sense of scripture,
we must, so far as it is possible, compare the phrases, or modes
of expression, as well as the subject insisted on, with what occurs
in other parallel places. Thus, in several of the historical
parts of scripture, we have the same history, or, at least, many
things tending to illustrate it; as the history of the reign of
the kings of Judah and Israel, is the principal subject of the
book of Kings and Chronicles; one of which often refers to,
as well as explains the other, and, by comparing them together,
we shall find, that one gives light to the other. Thus it is
said, in 2 Kings xii. 2. that <i>Jehoash did that which was right,
in the sight of the Lord all his days, wherein Jehoiada the
priest instructed him</i>; by which it is intimated, that, after the
death of Jehoiada, he did that which was evil in the sight of
the Lord; but this is not particularly mentioned in this chapter,
which principally insists on that part of his reign which
was commendable. But if we compare it with 2 Chron. xxiv. we
have an account of his reign after the death of Jehoiada, how
he <i>set up idolatry</i>, ver. 17, 18. being instigated hereunto by
his princes that flattered, or, as it is expressed, <i>made obeisance
unto him</i>, and disregarded the prophets sent to testify against
these practices; and how he <i>stoned Zachariah in the court of
the house of the Lord</i>, for his faithful reproof and prophetic
intimation of the consequence of the idolatry, in which he
shewed the greatest ingratitude, and forgetfulness of the good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>things that had been done for him by his father, who set him
on his throne. We have an account of the time when the Syrians
came up against him, and how they overcame him with
a small company of men; and, that <i>the Lord delivered a very
great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the Lord
God of their fathers</i>, ver. 23, 24.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in the book of Kings, we have but a short history
of the reign of Azariah, otherwise called Uzziah, and of his
being <i>smitten by the Lord, so that he was a leper until the day
of his death, and dwelt in a several house</i>, 2 Kings xv. 1-5.
but in 2 Chron. xxvi. there is a larger account of him, as successful
in war, and of the honour and riches that he gained
thereby; and also we have a particular account of the reason
of the Lord’s smiting him with leprosy, namely, for his invading
a branch of the priest’s office.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in the history of the reign of Manasseh, in 2 Kings
xxi. we have only an account of the vile and abominable part
thereof; whereas, in 2 Chron. xxxiii. we have not only an account
of his wickedness, but of his repentance, together with
the affliction that occasioned it, ver. 12-19.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, when we read the prophetic writings, we must,
for our better understanding them, compare them with the
particular history of the reign of those kings, in whose time
they prophesied, and the state of the church at that time, their
alliances or wars with neighbouring princes, and the sins that
they were guilty of, which gave occasion to their being sometimes
insulted, and overcome by them, till their ruin was completed
in being carried captive into Babylon. Thus when we
read Isa. vii. which gives an account of Rezin, king of Syria,
and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, against Ahaz, and contains
a prediction of their miscarriage in this attempt; and also, that
the king of Asyria should be hired to assist Ahaz, but should,
instead thereof, deal deceitfully with him, so that he should
deprive Judah of their ornaments, and impoverish, instead of
being helpful to them. This we have a farther explication of
in the history of Ahaz’s reign, in 2 Kings xvi. and 2 Chron.
xxviii.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Again, we ought to compare the account of Sennacherib’s
invading Judah, and the blasphemous insult of Rabshakeh sent
for that purpose, together with his defeat, and the remarkable
hand of God that brought this about, as an encouragement of
Hezekiah’s piety, in the xxxvith and xxxviith chapters of
Isaiah, with the historal account of the same thing, in 2 Kings
xviii. and xix. and 2 Chron. xxxii.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, we must compare the Psalms of David with his life,
or the state of the church, which is particularly referred to in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>some of them; which may be very much illustrated from other
scriptures, that have relation to the same dispensations of providence,
or contain an historical account thereof. As for those
psalms that were penned on particular occasions, mentioned in
the respective titles prefixed to them, these will be better understood
if we compare the subject-matter thereof with the
history they refer to. Moreover, we shall often find, that
when the same thing is mentioned in different places of scripture,
there is something added in one, which farther illustrates
what is contained in the other. Thus, in the account we have
of the life of Joseph, in Gen. xxxix. 20. it is said, that he was
<i>put into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were
bound</i>; and, in chap. xli. 14. that he was kept in the <i>dungeon</i>,
which is the worst part of the prison. But the Psalmist speaking
of the same matter, in Psal. cv. 18. adds, that his <i>feet were
hurt with fetters</i>, and he was <i>laid in iron</i>; which contains a
farther illustration of the history of his troubles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, when we read in Numb. xi. 31, 32. of God’s <i>feeding
Israel</i>, upon their murmuring in the desert, for want of flesh,
<i>with quails in great abundance</i>; this is mentioned elsewhere,
in Psal. lxxviii. 27. in which we have an account, that these
quails were a sort of <i>feathered fowl</i>, which could not have been
so well understood by the sense of the Hebrew word, which
we render <i>quails</i><a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a>. We have also an account, in Exod. xvii.
6. of God’s supplying them with <i>water out of the rock in
Horeb</i>; and if we compare this with Psal. cv. 41. we shall find
that this water issued from thence in so large a stream, that it
was like a <i>river</i>. And the apostle Paul gives farther light to
it, when he says, speaking in a figurative way, that <i>the rock
followed them</i>, 1 Cor. x. 4. that is, the water that ran from it
like a river, did not flow in a right line; but, by a continued
miracle, changed its course, as they altered their stations, in
their various removes from place to place in the wilderness.
And he also adds, that God designed this to be a type of Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>I might also observe, that there were many things in the life
of David, after his expulsion from Saul’s court, that would
argue him an usurper; inasmuch as he did not barely fly to
secure his life, which he might lawfully do, as a private person;
but he raised a small army; and accordingly it is said,
in 2 Sam. xxii. 2. that every one that was ‘in distress, or in
debt, or discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he
became a captain over him; and there were with him about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>four hundred men.’ And Jonathan, who was heir apparent
to the crown, is forced to capitulate with, and take an oath of
him, that he would grant him his life, as concluding, that he
would be king after his father’s death, 1 Sam. xx. 14, 15.
compared with the 42. and Saul’s jealousy hereof, which was
attended with rage, amounting to a kind of destraction, was
not altogether without ground; as he intimates to him, when
he tells him, ‘Behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be
king,’ chap. xxiv. 20. and accordingly, in the following verses,
he makes him ‘swear to him, that he would not cut off his
seed after him, or destroy his name out of his father’s house.’
Now this could hardly be justified, if we did not consider
what we read in another part of scripture, that, before that
time, God had taken away the kingdom from Saul, and anointed
David to be king in his stead, in 1 Sam. xvi. 13. though
he had not the actual possession of it till after Saul’s death.</p>

<p class='c006'>I might farther observe, that when we read the account contained
in the books of Moses, of the ceremonial law, and the
various rites and ordinances of divine service contained therein,
or meet with any expressions in the Old Testament that
refer to it; these ought to be compared with several things
that are recorded in the writings of the apostle Paul, and, particularly,
a very considerable part of his epistle to the Hebrews<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a>,
in which we have an account of the signification
thereof, as ordained to be types of the gospel-dispensation.
And, indeed, there are many scriptures of the Old Testament,
which will be better understood by comparing them with others
that refer to them in the New. Thus it is said, in Isa. xvi.
23. <i>Unto me every knee shall bow</i>; which appears to be very
agreeable to what is said concerning our Saviour, in Phil. ii.
10. and it is not only spoken of the divine honour that should
be paid to him; but it relates, in a peculiar manner, to that
glory which all shall ascribe to him, when they stand before
his tribunal, as appears by comparing it with Rom. xiv. 10, 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, when we read, in Isa. vi. 10. of God’s sending the
prophet to <i>make the heart of the people fat, and their ears
heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and
hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and
convert, and be healed</i>. It is not to be supposed that God is
represented hereby as the author of their sin; which will plainly
appear, if we compare it with Matt. xiii. 15. in which this
text is cited, and farther explained, as it is said, <i>This people’s
heart is waxed fat, and their eyes have they closed, lest they
should see with their eyes</i>, &amp;c. And it is also referred to, and
explained in the same sense as charging their sin, and the consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>thereof upon themselves, in Acts xxviii. 26, 27. By
this method of comparing the Old and New Testament together,
we shall be led to see the beautiful harmony of the
scriptures, and how the predictions thereof have been accomplished;
which will tend very much to establish our faith in
the truth of the Christian religion, that is founded on them.
But this having been insisted on elsewhere<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a>, we pass it over
at present, and proceed to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>That there are several places, in the New Testament, which
being compared together, will give light to one another. Thus,
in the four Evangelists, which contain the history of the life
and death of Christ, we may observe, that some things are left
out, or but briefly hinted at in one of them, which are more
largely insisted on in another. Thus we read, in Matt. xii.
14, 15. that ‘the Pharisees went out and held a counsel against
our Saviour, how they might destroy him;’ upon which occasion
‘he withdrew himself from thence. And great multitudes
followed him, and he healed them all.’ But Mark,
chap. iii. 17, <i>&amp; seq.</i> speaking concerning the same thing, intimates
that the Herodians were joined with the Pharisees in
this conspiracy; and that he ‘withdrew himself to the sea,’ <i>viz.</i>
of Tiberias; where he ordered that ‘a small ship should wait
on him, lest the multitude should throng him.’ And we have
also an account of several places from whence they came,
namely, Galilee, Jerusalem, Idumea, and from beyond Jordan,
and they about Tyre and Sidon, so that a great part of them
were Gentiles; and this gives light to what follows in Matt.
xii. 18, 21. in which it is intimated, that this was an accomplishment
of what was <i>foretold by the prophet Isaias</i>, that he
should <i>shew judgment to the Gentiles</i>; and that, <i>in his name
should the Gentiles trust</i>; therefore he wrought miracles for
their conviction that he was the Messias.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, it is said, in Matt. xiii. 12. ‘Whosoever hath, to
him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance. But
whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away, even that
he hath.’ Some will be ready to enquire, how can that which
he hath be said to be taken away, when he is supposed to have
nothing? or, how can a person be said to lose that which he
never had? But if compare this with a parallel scripture, in
Luke viii. 18. there it is said, <i>Whosoever hath not, from him
shall be taken, even that which he seemeth to have</i>; or, as it is
in the margin, <i>that which he thinketh he hath</i>. Now, though
a man cannot lose grace, that had it not; yet an hypocrite,
who seems to have it, may lose that which he supposeth himself
to have.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>This method of comparing the four Evangelists together, is
attempted by several divines; and, among them, a late writer,
who is deservedly esteemed by all the reformed churches<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a>,
thinks, that the inscription, on the cross of Christ, can hardly
be determined, without what is said of it, by all the four
Evangelists. Mark says these words were written, <i>The king
of the Jews</i>, Mark xv. 26. and Luke says, <i>This is the king of
the Jews</i>, Luke xxiii. 38. and Matthew adds another word,
<i>This is Jesus, the king of the Jews</i>, Matt. xxvii. 37. and John
expresses it thus, <i>Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews</i>,
John xix. 19. So that, by comparing them all together, and
supplying those words from one, which are left out by others
of them, we must conclude, that the inscription was, <i>This is
Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, as the Acts of the Apostles contains a brief history
of the first planting the gospel-church, and of the travels and
ministry of the apostle Paul, in particular; this ought to be
compared with some things, occasionally mentioned in his
epistles, which will give farther light to them. Thus the
apostle says, in 1 Cor. xv. 8. <i>Last of all, he was seen of me
also, as one born out of due time</i>; and speaks of himself in ver.
9. as the <i>least of the apostles, not meet to be called an apostle;
because he persecuted the church of God</i>. This ought to be
compared with Acts ix. 1-6. which gives an account of him
as a persecutor before his conversion, and shews how our Saviour
was seen of him; which is not to be taken in the same
sense as he was seen by the rest of the apostles, before his ascension
into heaven; but of his being seen of him, after his
ascension, when, on this occasion, he appeared to him. And,
if this be compared with 1 Cor. ix. 1. he considers this sight
of Jesus as a necessary qualification for the apostleship; therefore,
when he speaks of himself as <i>born out of due time</i>, he
means, called to, and qualified for the apostleship, out of due
time; that is, not at the same time in which the other apostles
were, but by this extraordinary dispensation of providence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, when the apostle, in 1 Thes. ii. 2. speaks of his
having been <i>shamefully entreated at Philippi</i>. This will be
better understood if we compare it with Acts xvi. 16, 21, 22,
<i>&amp; seq.</i> And when he tells the Thessalonians, in the following
words, <i>that we were bold in our God, to speak unto you the
gospel of God with much contention</i>; this should be compared
with Acts xvii. 1, <i>&amp; seq.</i> Many instances of the like nature
might be given, by which, the usefulness of comparing one
scripture with another, would farther appear. But, I design
this only as a specimen, to assist us in the application of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>direction; which a diligent enquirer into the sense of scripture,
will be able, in reading it, to make farther improvements
upon.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) In order to our understanding the scriptures, we must
take notice of the several figurative modes of speaking that are
used therein. As,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, The part is often put for the whole<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a>. Thus the soul,
which is one constituent part of man, is sometimes put for the
whole man; as in Gen. xlvi. 26. we read of the souls that
came with Jacob into Egypt; and, in Rom. xii. 1. the body
is put for the whole man; <i>I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies
of God, that you present your bodies</i>, that is, yourselves, <i>a
living sacrifice to God</i>. So the blood of Christ, which is often
spoken of, in scripture, as that by which we are redeemed,
justified, and saved, is to be taken for the whole of his obedience
and sufferings, both in life and death, to which our salvation
is to be ascribed, as well as to the effusion of his blood.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, The thing containing, is put for that which is contained
therein<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a>; so the cup in the Lord’s supper, is put for the wine,
1 Cor. xi. 25. And the thing signified is put for the sign
thereof. Thus when it is said, <i>This is my body</i>, ver. 24. the
meaning is, this bread is a sign of my body, to wit, of the sufferings
endured therein.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Places are, by way of anticipation, called by those
names, which in reality, were not given them, or, which they
were not commonly known by, till some time after. Thus it
is said, that, as soon as Israel had passed over Jordan, they
<i>encamped in Gilgal</i>, Josh. iv. 19. that is, in the place which
was afterwards so called; for it is said, that it was called
Gilgal because there they were circumcised; and so the <i>reproach
of Egypt</i>, occasioned by the neglect of that ordinance, <i>was rolled
away</i>, chap. v. 9. Again, it is said, <i>The kings that came up
against Sodom</i>, when Lot was taken prisoner, <i>had smitten all
the country of the Amalekites</i>, Gen. xiv. 7. whereas, the country
that was afterwards known by that name, could not be so
called at that time; since Amalek, from whom it took its
name, was not born till some ages after, he being of the posterity
of Esau, chap. xxxvi. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, The time past, or present, is often, especially in the
prophetic writings, put for the time to come; which denotes
the certain performance of the prediction, as much as though
it were actually accomplished. Thus it is said, <i>He</i>, that is,
our Saviour, <i>is despised and rejected of men; he hath born our
griefs, he was wounded for our transgressions</i>, Isa. liii. 4, 5.
And elsewhere, <i>The people that walked in darkness have seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>a great light</i>, chap. ix. 2. and <i>unto us a child is born</i>, chap. v.
9. <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>5thly</i>, One of the senses is sometimes put for another. Thus
it is said, <i>I turned to see the voice that spake to me</i>, Rev. i. 12.
where seeing is put for hearing, or, understanding the meaning
of the voice that spake.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>6thly</i>, Positive assertions are sometimes taken in a comparitive
sense. Thus God says to Samuel, the people in asking
a king, <i>have not rejected thee, but me</i>, 1 Sam. viii. 7. that is,
they have cast more contempt on me than they have on thee,
<i>q. d.</i> they have offered a greater affront to my government,
who condescended to be their king; though they have been
uneasy under thine administration, as appointed to be their
judge. And, in Psal. li. 4. David says, <i>Against thee, thee
only, have I sinned</i>. Whereas he had sinned against Uriah
and Bathsheba, as having murdered the one, and tempted the
other to commit adultery with him; he had sinned against the
army, whom he occasioned to fall in battle, pursuant to the
orders he gave Joab, with a design to destroy Uriah; yet says
he, <i>against thee, thee only, have I sinned</i>; that is, the greatest
aggravation of my sin is, that it contains rebellion against thee.
And elsewhere, God says, <i>I desired mercy, and not sacrifice</i>,
Hos. vi. 6. that is, more than sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>7thly</i>, There are several hyperbolical ways of speaking in
scripture, whereby more is expressed than what is generally
understood. Thus the vessel in the temple, in which things
were washed, which was ten cubits from one brim to the other,
is called <i>a molten Sea</i>, 1 Kings vii. 23. because it contained a
great quantity of water; though, indeed, it was very small, if
compared with the dimensions of the sea: And in 1 Kings x.
27, it is said, that Solomon <i>made silver to be in Jerusalem, as
stones; and cedars as the sycamore-trees, which are in the vale
for abundance</i>. Silver was not, strictly speaking, as plentiful
as stones; but it implies, that there were vast treasures thereof,
heaped up by the king, and many of his subjects, and no
lack of it in any one. And, in Judges xx. 16. it is said, there
were <i>some of the Benjamites left-handed, every one</i> of whom
<i>could sling stones at an hair-breadth, and not miss</i>; which only
signifies that they had an uncommon expertness in this matter;
and when we read of some of the cities in the land of Canaan,
that were <i>great, and walled up to heaven</i>, Deut. i. 28. it
only denotes that their walls were very high: And, in Kings
i. 43. it is said upon the occasion of Solomon’s being anointed
king, that <i>the people rejoiced with great joy; so that the
earth rent with the sound of them</i>; the meaning of which is
only this, that the shouts of the people were so great, that if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the concussion of the air, that was made thereby, could have
rent the earth, this would have done it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>8thly</i>, We sometimes find ironical expressions, and sarcasms
used in scripture, with a design to expose the wickedness and
folly of men. Thus, when our first parents sinned by adhering
to the suggestions of Satan, who told them, that they
<i>should be as gods, knowing good and evil</i>, Gen. iii. 5. God says
in an ironical way, <i>Behold the man is become as one of us, to
know good and evil, &amp;c.</i> ver. 22. And the prophet Elijah exposes
Baal’s worshippers; and Micaiah, Ahab’s false prophets,
by using a sarcastic way of speaking, 1 Kings xviii. 27. and
chap. xxii. 15. And Job uses the same figurative way of speaking,
when he reproves the bitter invectives, and false reasonings
of his friends; <i>No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom
shall die with you</i>, Job xii. 2. And Solomon uses the same way
of address, when he says, <i>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth,
and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of youth, and walk
in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: But
know thou, that for all these things God bring thee into
Judgment</i>, Eccl. xi. 9. And, the man that trusts in his own
righteousness for justification, is also exposed in the same way,
‘Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves
about with sparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in the
sparks that ye have kindled: This shall ye have of mine
hand, ye shall lie down in sorrow,’ Isa. l. 11. And when our
Saviour says to his disciples, having found them asleep, in
Matt. xxvi. 45, 46. ‘Sleep on now, and take your rest; behold
the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into
the hands of sinners,’ it is plain from the following words,
that he uses this figurative way of speaking; for he immediately
adds, without an irony, <i>Rise, let us be going</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This, some think to be the method of speaking which our
Saviour makes use of, when he reproves his disciples for that
fond conceit that they had, that his kingdom was of this world;
and contending sometimes among themselves, who should be
greatest therein: Upon which occasion he bids them make
provision for war; and take care to secure those two things
that are necessary thereunto, money and arms: Thus he says,
in Luke xxii. 36. ‘He that hath a purse, let him take it; and
he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one;’
they did not, indeed, immediately perceive that he spake in
an ironical way; and therefore replied, in ver. 38. <i>Lord, behold
here are two swords</i>: Upon which he says, still carrying
on the irony, <i>It is enough</i>. So that, whether they understood
his meaning or no, it seems to be this; if you are disposed to
contend who shall be greatest, as though my kingdom were of
a temporal nature, and to be erected and maintained by force
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>of arms, do you think you have sufficient treasure to hire
forces to join with you, or buy arms for that purpose? or, do
you imagine that you have courage enough to attack the Roman
empire, and gain it by force? You say, you have two
swords, can you suppose that these are enough? what a ludicrious
and indifferent figure would you make, if you expected
to come off conquerors by this means? No, they that take the
sword shall perish with the sword; for my kingdom is not of
this world: So that all the advantages and honours that you
are to expect therein, are of a spiritual nature. This seems
rather to be the meaning of this scripture, than that which the
Papists generally acquiesce in, namely, that by the <i>two</i> swords,
are meant the civil and ecclesiastical; both which, as they pretend,
are put into the Pope’s hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>9thly, The scripture often makes use of a figurative way of
speaking, generally called an <i>hendyadis</i>, whereby one complex
idea, is expressed by two words, which is very common in the
Hebrew language. Thus in Jer. xxix. 11. when God promises
his people, that he would <i>give</i> them <i>an expected end</i>, intending
hereby their deliverance from the Babylonish captivity;
the words, if literally translated, ought to be rendered, as
it is observed in the margin, <i>an end and expectation</i>; whereas,
our translators were apprized that there is such a figurative
way of speaking contained in them, and therefore they render
them, <i>an expected end</i>: And this figure is sometimes used in
the New Testament; as when our Saviour tells his disciples,
in Luke xxi. 15. <i>I will give you a mouth and wisdom</i>; that is,
I will give you ability to express yourselves with so much wisdom,
<i>that all your adversaries shall not be able to gain-say</i> it.
And some think, that there is the same way of speaking used
in John iii. 5. ‘Except a man be born of water, and of the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God;’ that is,
except a man be born of the Holy Spirit, or regenerated,
which is signified by being born of water, he cannot, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>10thly</i>, Nothing is more common than for the Holy Ghost,
in scripture to make use of metaphors, which are a very elegant
way of representing things, by comparing them with, and
illustrating them by others, and borrowing such modes of
speaking from them, as may add a very considerable beauty
to them. Thus repentance and godly sorrow, together with the
blessed privileges which shall hereafter attend them, are compared
to sowing and reaping, in Psal. cxxvi. 5, 6. ‘They that
sow in tears, shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and
weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again
with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.’ And the
prophet sets forth the labour and pains which Israel had taken
in sin; and exhorts them, by a metaphor taken from husbandry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>to be as industrious in pursuing what would turn to
a better account, in Hos. x. 12, 13. where he speaks of their
having <i>plowed wickedness, and reaped iniquity</i>; and advises
them to <i>sow to themselves in righteousness, and reap in mercy</i>;
which, as he farther adds, they should do by <i>seeking the Lord</i>;
and <i>it is time</i>, says he, <i>to seek</i> him, <i>till he come and rain righteousness
upon you</i>; which is necessary to a plenteous harvest
of blessings, which you may hope for in so doing. And, in
chap. vii. 4. he reproves their adulteries by a metaphor, taken
from <i>an oven heated by the baker</i>; and their hypocrisy by
another, taken from <i>a cake not turned</i>, ver. 8. and their being
weakened, and almost ruined hereby, he compares to the <i>gray
hairs</i> of those who are bowed down under the infirmities of
age, ver. 9. and for their cowardice and seeking help from
other nations, and not from God, he calls them <i>a silly dove
without an heart</i>, ver. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>And we may observe, that there is oftentimes a chain of
metaphors in the same paragraph. Of this kind is that elegant
description of old age, sickness, and death, which Solomon
gives, in exhorting persons to <i>remember their Creator in the
days of their youth</i>, Eccl. xii. 1-6. <i>while the sun, or the light,
or the moon, or the stars be not darkened</i>; by which, it is probable,
he intends the impairing the intellect, the loss of those
sprightly parts which once they had, or, of the memory and
judgment; upon which account men are sometimes said to,
out-live themselves. And he speaks of <i>the keepers of the house
trembling</i>; that is, the hands and arms, designed for the defence
of the body, being seized with paralytic disorders; <i>the
strong men bowing themselves</i>; that is, those parts which are
designed to support the body being weakened, and needing a
staff to bear up themselves; <i>the grinders ceasing because they
are few</i>, signifies the loss of teeth; <i>and they that look out of
the windows being darkened</i>, a decay of sight; their <i>rising up
at the voice of the bird</i>, implies their loss of one of the main
props of nature, to wit, sleep; so that they may rise early in
the morning, when the birds begin to sing, because their beds
will not afford them rest: <i>And the daughters of music being
brought low</i>, denotes a decay of the voice and hearing, and
being not affected with those sounds which were once most delightful
to them. <i>The almond-tree flourishing</i>, plainly signifies
the hoary head; <i>the grashopper</i> being <i>a burden</i>, is either
a proverbial speech, importing a want of courage, strength,
and resolution to bear the smallest pressures; or, as others
understand it, their stooping, when bowed down with old age.
<i>The silver cord loosed</i>, or, <i>the golden bowl broken at the fountain,
or the wheel broken at the cistern</i>, signifies a decay of
the animal spirits, a laxation of the nerves, the irregular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>circulation of the blood, or the universal stoppage thereof;
and then the frame of nature is broken, and man <i>returns to the
dust</i><a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the New Testament there are several metaphors used;
some of which are taken from the Isthmian and Olympic
games, practised by the Greeks and Romans. Thus the
apostle Paul compares the Christian life to <i>a race</i> in which <i>many
run</i>; but they do not all <i>receive the prize</i>, 1 Cor. ix. 24.
And, in ver. 25. he alludes to another exercise, to wit, wrestling;
and recommends temperance as what was practised by
them, as a means for their obtaining the crown. And, ver.
26. he uses a metaphor, taken from another of the games, to
wit, fighting, in hope of victory; by which he illustrates his
zeal in the discharge of his ministry. And in Heb. xii. 1. he
speaks of the Christian <i>race</i>, and the necessity of <i>laying aside
every weight</i>, to wit, allowed sins, which would retard our
course, or hinder us in the way to heaven. And in Phil. iii.
13, 14. he speaks of himself both as a minister and a Christian,
as ‘forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching
forth unto those things which are before,’ and, ‘pressing
towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling of
God in Christ Jesus;’ where he plainly alludes to the purpose,
industry, and earnestness of those who run in a race.
And, in Eph. vi. 11-16. he speaks of the difficulties, temptations,
and opposition that believers are exposed to, in the
Christian life; and advises them, to <i>put on the whole armour
of God</i>; and so carries on the metaphor or allegory, by alluding
to the various pieces of armour, which soldiers make
use of when engaged in battle, to illustrate the methods we
ought to take, that we may come off conquerors at last.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) It will be very useful, in order to our understanding
scripture, for us to know some things, relating to the different
forms of civil government, and the various changes made
therein, among the Jews, and other nations, with whom they
were conversant. At first we find, that distinct families had
the administration of civil affairs committed unto them, and
the heads thereof were, as it were, the chief magistrates,
who had the exercise of civil power, in some instances; especially
if it did not interfere with that of the country wherein
they lived. Some think, indeed, that it extended to the
punishing capital crimes with death; and that Judah, who
was the head of a branch of Jacob’s family, when he passes
this sentence concerning Tamar, in Gen. xxxviii. 24.
<i>Bring her forth, and let her be burnt</i>, does it as a civil magistrate:
But, if it be not deemed a rash and unjustifiable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>expression in him, when he says, <i>Let her be brought forth, and
burnt</i>, we must suppose the meaning to be, let her first be confined
till she is delivered of her child, and then tried by the
civil magistrate, the consequence whereof will be, her being
burnt, when found guilty of the adultery that was charged
upon her. So that it does not appear that the heads of families,
when sojourning in other countries, had a power distinct
from that of the government under which they lived,
to punish offenders with death; though, I think, it is beyond
dispute, that they had a government in their own families,
that extended, in many respects, to civil affairs, as
well as obliged them to observe those religious duties which
God required of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be farther observed, that this government extended
so far, as that the Patriarchs, or heads of families, had,
sometimes, a power of making war, or entering into confederacies
with neighbouring princes, for their own safety,
or recovering their rights when invaded. Thus when Lot
and the Sodomites, were taken prisoners by the four kings
that came up against them, we read, in Gen. xiv. 13, 14.
that Abraham called in the assistance of some of his neighbours,
with whom he was in confederacy, and <i>armed his trained
servants, three hundred and eighteen, born in his house</i>, and
rescued him, and the men of Sodom from the hands of those
that had taken them prisoners.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have little more light as to this matter, so long as
the government continued domestic, and the church in the
condition of sojourners: But, when they were increased to
a great nation, their civil, as well as religious government,
was settled, by divine direction, under the hand of Moses,
in the wilderness. The first form thereof, was a theocracy,
in which God gave them laws in an immediate way; condescended
to satisfy them, as to some things, which they enquired
of him about; gave them particular intimations how
they should manage their affairs of war and peace; and appeared
for them in giving them victory over their enemies,
in a very extraordinary, and sometimes, miraculous way.
But, besides this great honour that God put on them, he
established a form of government among them, in which they
were divided into <i>thousands</i>, <i>hundreds</i>, <i>fifties</i>, and <i>tens</i>, Exod.
xviii. 31. Deut. i. 15. each of which divisions had their respective
captain or governor; who are, sometimes, styled the
<i>nobles of the children of Israel</i>, Exod. xxiv. 11. And these
governors were generally heads of considerable families among
them; which were also divided in the same way, into thousands,
fifties, and tens, in proportion to the largeness thereof;
thus Gideon, speaking of his family, in Judges vi. 25. calls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>it, as the Hebrew word signifies, his <i>thousand</i>. And, in the
same manner, their armies were divided, when engaged in
war; thus when Jesse sent David with a present, into the
army, to his brethren, he bade him deliver it to the <i>captain
over their thousand</i>, 1 Sam. xvii. 18. and chap. xviii. 13. And
we read, that Saul made David his <i>captain over a thousand</i>;
which is the same with what we, in our modern way of
speaking, call a commanding officer over a regiment of soldiers.
Again, when David’s soldiers went out to war against
Absalom, it is said, <i>They came out by hundreds and by thousands</i>,
2 Sam. xviii. 4. each distinct company, or regiment,
having their commanding officer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the government was settled as to civil and military
affairs, in such a way, that the head of the respective division,
had a power of judging in lesser matters. But since there
were some affairs of the greatest importance to be transacted
in the form of their government, by divine direction, God appointed
seventy men of the children of Israel, to assist Moses
in those matters, in which they had more immediately to do
with him; and accordingly he <i>gave them the Spirit</i>, Numb. xi.
16, 17. that is, the extraordinary inspiration of the Spirit;
whereby he communicated his mind and will to them. This
was the first rise of the Sanhedrim; and these had a power of
judging in civil matters, throughout all the ages of the church
till the Jews were made tributary to the Romans; and after
that, this body of men were as vile and contemptible as they
had before been honourable in the eyes of just and good men,
as appears by their tumultuous and unprecedented behaviour
in the trial of our Saviour, and the malicious prosecutions, set
on foot by them, against the apostles, without any pretence or
form of law.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the death of Joshua, and the elders that survived him,
there was an alteration in the form of government, occasioned
by the oppression which they were liable to from their enemies,
who insulted, vexed, and sometimes plundered them of
their substance. Then God raised up judges, who first procured
peace for them, by success in war; and afterwards governed
them; though without the character or ensigns of royal
dignity. And, this government not being successive, they
were, on the death of their respective judges, brought into
great confusion, every one doing that which was right in his
own eyes, till another judge was raised up, as some future
emergency required it. Thus the posture of their affairs continued,
as the apostle observes, <i>about the space of four hundred
and fifty years</i>, Acts xiii. 20. and then it was altered, when,
through their unsettled temper, they desired a king, in conformity
to the custom of the nations round about them;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>which thing was displeasing to God: nevertheless, he granted
them their request, 1 Sam. viii. 5-7. and so the government
became regal. And then followed a succession of kings,
set over the whole nation, till the division between Judah
and Israel; when they became two distinct kingdoms, and
so continued, till their respective captivity. These things being
duly considered, will give great light to several things
contained in scripture; especially as to what relates to the
civil affairs of the church of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, for our farther understanding thereof, it will be necessary
that we take a view of the government of other nations,
with whom they were often conversant. We read almost
of as many kings in scripture, as there were cities in
several of those countries which lay round about them; thus,
in Gen. xxxvi. we read of many dukes and kings, (whose
power was much the same) who descended from Esau. These
had very small dominions, each of them being, as it is probable,
the chief governor of one city, or, at most, of a little
tract of land round about it; and, indeed, besides the Assyrian,
and other monarchies, that were of a very large extent,
and had none who stood in competition with them, under
that character, while they subsisted; all other kingdoms
were very small; therefore four kings were obliged to enter
into a confederacy, to make war with Sodom, and the
four neighbouring cities, which a very inconsiderable army
might, without much difficulty, have subdued, Gen. xiv. 1,
<i>&amp;c.</i> One of them, indeed, is called king of nations; not as
though he had large dominions, but because he was the chief
governor of a mixed people, from divers nations, who were
settled together in one distinct colony; and the king of Shinar,
there spoken of, is not the king of Babylon, who was
too potent a prince to have stood in need of others to join
with him in this expedition; but it was a petty king, who
reigned in some city near Babylon, and was tributary to the
Assyrian empire. These four kings, with all their forces,
were so few in number, that Abraham was not afraid to attack
them; which he did with success.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, we read, that in Joshua’s time, the kings in the
land of Canaan, whom he subdued, had, each of them, very
small dominions, consisting of but one capital city, with a few
villages round about it. Thus we read of thirty one kings that
reigned in that country, which was not so big as a fourth part
of the kingdom of England, Josh. xii. And afterwards most
of these kingdoms were swallowed up by the Assyrian empire.
Thus the king of Assyria, as Rabshakeh boasts, had entirely
conquered the kings of Hamath, Arphad, Gozan, and
Haran, with several others, 2 Kings xix. 12, 13. these had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>very small dominions, and therefore were easily subdued by
forces so much superior to any that they could raise. Egypt,
indeed, was more formidable; and therefore we often read in
scripture of Israel’s having recourse to them for help, and are
blamed for trusting in them more than God: And, in Arabia,
there were some kings who had large dominions, as appears by
the vast armies that they raised: Thus <i>Zerah the Ethiopian
came forth against Asa, with a thousand thousand men</i>, 2
Chron. xvi. 19. Nevertheless, the church of God was able to
stand its ground; for, whether the neighbouring kings were
many of them, confederate against them, or the armies they
raised, exceeding numerous, like the sand on the sea shore;
they had safety and protection, as well as success in war,
from the care and blessing of providence; of which we have
an account in the history of scripture relating thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>(7.) It will be of some advantage, in order to our understanding
the sense of scripture, for us to enquire into the
meaning of those civil and religious offices and characters, by
which several persons are described, both in the Old and New
Testament. Concerning the Priests and Levites, we have had
occasion frequently to insist on their call and office: Among
the former of these, one is styled <i>high-priest</i>; who was not
only the chief minister in holy things under the Jewish dispensation;
but presided over the other priests in all those
things that respected the temple-service. There was also another
priest, who had pre-eminence over his brethren, that was
next to the high-priest in office, who seems to be referred to,
in 2 Kings xxv. 18. where we read of <i>Seriah, the chief priest,
and Zephaniah the second priest</i>. This office is not often mentioned
in scripture, but is frequently spoken of by Jewish writers:
They call him, who was employed therein, as the author
of the Chaldee paraphrase does on that text, the Sagan: And,
some think, that this office was first instituted in Numb. iii.
32. in which Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest was to be
<i>chief over the chief of the Levites, and to have the oversight of
them, that kept the charge of the sanctuary</i>: And elsewhere,
we read of Zadok and Abiathar, being, by way of eminency,
<i>priests at the same time</i>, 2 Sam. xv. 35. by which, it is probable,
we are to understand, as many expositors do, that one
was the <i>high priest</i>, the other the <i>Sagan</i>; who was to perform
the office that belonged to the high priest in all the branches
thereof, if he should happen to be incapacitated for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides these, there were others who were styled <i>chief-priests</i>,
as being the heads of their respective classes, and presided
over them when they came to Jerusalem, to minister in
their courses. There was also the president of the Sanhedrim,
who is generally reckoned one of the chief priests. Moreover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>when any one was by the arbitrary will of the governors, in
the degenerate and declining state of the Jewish church, deposed
from the high-priesthood, barely to make way for another
favourite to enjoy that honour, he was, though divested
of his office, nevertheless called chief priest. This will give
light to several scriptures in the New Testament, in which we
often read of many chief priests at the same time, See Luke
iii. 2. Mark xiv. 53.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, as to the Levites, these were not only appointed to
be the high priest’s ministers in offering gifts and sacrifices in
the temple; but many of them were engaged in other offices;
some in instructing the people, in the respective cities where they
dwelt, who were to resort to them for that purpose, or in synagogues,
erected for this branch of public worship. Others
were employed as judges in determining civil or ecclesiastical,
matters.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, we often read, in scripture, of Scribes: These were
of two sorts; some were employed only in civil matters; and
we sometimes read of one person, in particular, who was appointed
to be the king’s scribe. Thus in David’s reign, we
read of Shemaiah the scribe, and in Hezekiah’s of Shebna,
1 Chron. xxiv. 6. 2 Kings xviii. 18. This seems to have been
a civil officer, not much unlike a secretary of state among us;
and we seldom find mention made of more than one scribe at
a time, except in Solomon’s reign in which there were two,
1 Kings iv. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>But besides this, we often read of scribes who were engaged
in other works; thus it is generally supposed, that many of
them were employed in transcribing the whole, or some parts
of scripture, for the use of those who employed them therein,
and gratified them for it; which was necessary for the
propagating religion in those ages, in which printing was
not known.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were others who explained the law to the people.
Thus Ezra is styled, <i>a ready scribe in the law of Moses</i>, Ezra,
vii. 6. This was an honourable and useful employment,
faithfully managed by him and many others, in the best ages
of the church. But, in our Saviour’s time, there were scribes
who pretended to expound the law, and instruct the people;
but the doctrines they propagated, were very contrary to the
mind of the Holy Ghost in Moses’s writings; and their way
of preaching was very empty and unprofitable: Upon which
occasion it is said, that our Lord <i>taught as one having authority,
and not as the scribes</i>, Matt. vii. 29.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we sometimes read in the New-Testament, of
Lawyers, against whom our Saviour denounces woes, for opposing
him and his gospel. This is supposed by some, to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>only a different name given to the scribes; inasmuch as they
practised the law in public courts of judicature, and pleaded
causes in the Sanhedrin, or taught in their schools or religious
assemblies; both which the scribes did. And the evangelist
Matthew, speaking concerning a lawyer, who asked our Saviour
a question, <i>Which is the great commandment</i>, chap. xxii.
35, 36. Mark mentioning the same thing, calls him <i>one of the
scribes</i>, Mark xii. 28. So that the same thing, for substance,
seems to be intended by both of them; or if there was any
difference between them, as others suppose there was, from
what is said in Luke xi. 44, 45. that when our Saviour had
been reproving the scribes and Pharisees, <i>One of the lawyers
said unto him, thus saying thou reproachest us also</i>, where they
speak as though they were distinct from them: yet it is evident
from hence, that however they might be distinguished
from them, in other respects, they agreed with them as engaged
in expounding the law, and herein are said to lade <i>men
with heavy burdens and grievous to be born</i>; which they themselves
would <i>not touch with one of their fingers</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for those civil officers which we read of in the Old Testament
before the captivity, especially in David and Solomon’s
reign, they were either such as were set over the tribute, the
principal of which was at the head of the treasury, 1 Kings iv.
6. and others were employed under them, to see that the
taxes were duly levied and paid: These are called receivers,
Isa. xxxiii. 18. Others were employed in keeping and adjusting
the public records, of which, one was the chief; who, by
way of eminence, is called the recorder: And others were appointed
to manage the king’s domestic affairs, of which, the
chief was <i>set over the household</i>, 2 Kings xviii. 18. Another is
said to be <i>set over the host</i>, 1 Kings iv. 4. who either had the
chief command of the army, or else was appointed to muster
and determine who should go to war, or be excused from it.
And there is another officer we read of once in scripture, <i>viz.</i>
he that <i>counted the towers</i>, Isa. xxxiii. 18. whose business
seems to have been to survey and keep the fortifications in repair;
but these not being so frequently mentioned in scripture
as others, we pass them over, and proceed more especially
to consider some characters of persons we meet with in
the New Testament.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was one sort of officers who were concerned in exacting
the public revenues, after the Jews were made tributary
to the Roman empire: These are called publicans; the
chief of which were generally persons of great honour and
substance, who sometimes farmed a branch of the revenue,
and they were, for the most part, Romans of noble extract, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>whom we have an account in Cicero<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a>, and other heathen writers;
but there is no mention of them in scripture. This honourable
post was never conferred on the Jews; nevertheless,
we read of Zaccheus, who is said to have been one <i>of the chief
among the publicans</i>, though a Jew, Luke xix. 2. the meaning
of which is, that he was the chief officer in a particular port,
who had other publicans under him; whose business was,
constantly to attend at the ports, and take an account of the
taxes that were to be paid there, by those of whom they were
exacted. Of this latter sort was Matthew, who is called the
publican, <i>i. e.</i> one of the lowest officers concerned in the revenue,
Matt. x. 3. compared with chap. ix. 9. These were
usually very profligate in their morals, and inclined to oppress
those of whom they received taxes, probably to gain advantage
to themselves; and were universally hated by the Jews.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was another sort of men often mentioned in the New
Testament, that made the greatest pretensions to religion, but
were most remote from it, and justly branded with the character
of hypocrites, to wit, the Pharisees, who made themselves
popular by their external shew of piety. There is not, indeed,
the least hint of there being such a sect amongst the Jews before
the captivity; though, it is true, the prophet Isaiah, Isa.
lxv. 5. speaks of a sort of people that much resembled them,
which said, <i>Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier
than thou</i>; from whence, it seems, that there were some
of like principles in his day; unless we suppose that this
scripture had its accomplishment when the sect of the Pharisees
appeared in the world in a following age; which was
not long after the reign of Alexander the great<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a>, between
two and three hundred years before our Saviour’s time. They
are generally described in scripture, as pretending to be more
expert than all others in the knowledge of the law; but, in
reality, making it void, by establishing those oral traditions,
which were contrary to the true intent and meaning thereof,
and, as setting up their own righteousness, and depending on
the performance of some lesser duties of the law, as that from
whence they expected a right to eternal life. These were the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>greatest enemies, in their conduct, as well as their doctrines,
to Christ, and his gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was another sect that joined with the Pharisees, in
persecuting and opposing our Saviour; though otherwise they
did not, in the least, accord with one another; and these were
the Sadducees, who appeared in the world about the same
time with the Pharisees: These were men generally reputed
as profligate in their morals, and for that reason, as much
hated by the common people, as the Pharisees were caressed
by them. They adhered to the Philosophy of Epicurus; and
took occasion, from thence to deny the resurrection, angels,
and spirits, as they are said to do in scripture, Acts xxiii. 8.
It is true they did not desire to be thought irreligious, though
they were really so; yet our Saviour describes them, as well
as the Pharisees, as <i>hypocrites</i>, and inveterate enemies of the
gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was another sort of people sometimes mentioned
in the New Testament, <i>viz.</i> the Samaritans, who separated
from the Jews, out of a private pique, and built a distinct
temple on mount Gerizzim<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a>; and for this they were excommunicated
by the Jews, and universally hated, so that
there was no intercourse between them, John iv. 9, especially
in those things in which one might be said to be obliged
to the other: These did very much corrupt the worship of
God, so that Christ charges them with <i>worshipping they
knew not what</i>, ver. 12. and it is observed concerning them,
after the ten tribes were carried captive into Assyria, and
they who were left in the land <i>feared not the Lord</i>, that he
<i>sent lions amongst them</i>, 2 Kings xvii. 25. upon which occasion
a priest was dismissed by the king of Assyria, under pretence
of <i>instructing them in the manner of the God of the land</i>;
and he erected a strange medly of religion, consisting partly
of those corruptions therein, which had been practised by the
Israelites for some ages past, and partly of the Heathen
idolatry, which they brought from Assyria; upon which account
it is said, <i>They feared the Lord, and served their own
gods after the manner of the nations whom they carried away
from thence</i>, 2 Kings xvii. 33.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another sort of men, mentioned in the New Testament,
who are called Herodians: These seem to have been a
political rather than a religious sect. Some of the Fathers, indeed,
think that they were so called because they complimented
Herod with the character of the Messiah<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a>, who, as they
supposed, would be a very flourishing prince, who was to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>reign over them, according to the ancient prediction of the patriarch
Jacob, after <i>the sceptre was departed from Judah</i>: But
this seems to be a very improbable conjecture; for <i>Herod the
Great</i> was dead, before we read any thing of the Herodians in
scripture: And the Jews had an opinion, about this time, that
the Messiah should never die, John xii. 34. Therefore, the
most probable opinion is, that these Herodians were, in their
first rise, the favourites and courtiers of Herod, and disposed
to give into any alterations that he was inclined to make in
the religious or civil affairs of the Jews<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a>. By what is said
concerning them in scripture, it is supposed, that they were,
for thy most part, Sadducees; for if we compare Matt. xvi. 6.
with Mark viii. 15. our Saviour warns his disciples upon the
same occasion, to wit, their having <i>forgot to take bread</i>, to <i>beware
of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees</i>; as
the former evangelist expresses it, and <i>of the leaven of Herod</i>,
viz. the Herodians, as it is in the latter: Now, though these
Herodians, or court-parasites, might take their first rise in the
reign of Herod the Great; yet there was a party of men succeeded
them, who held the same principles, and were disposed
to compliment their governors with their civil and religious
rights; but they more especially distinguished themselves, by
their propagating principles of loyalty among the people:
And, whereas the Jews, under a pretence that they were a
free nation, were very unwilling to give tribute to Cesar,
(though they would not venture their lives as Judas of Galilee,
and some others had done, by refusing it;) these Herodians
laid it down as an article of their faith, that they ought
to pay tribute to Cesar; and therefore, when they came with
this question to our Saviour, <i>Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar,
or not?</i> Matt. xxii. 17. he soon discovered their hypocrisy,
and knew the design of that question as he might easily
do from their being Herodians. Thus concerning the various
characters of persons mentioned in scripture, as subservient
to our understanding thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>(8.) After all these helps for the understanding the sense of
scripture, there is one more which is universally to be observed;
namely, that no sense is to be given of any text, but
what is agreeable to the analogy of faith, has a tendency to
advance the divine perfections, stain the pride of all flesh, in
the sight of God, and, promote practical godliness in all its
branches.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, Scripture must be explained agreeably to the analogy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>of faith. It is supposed that there is something we depend on,
which we can prove to be the faith of scripture, or demonstrably
founded upon it: This we are bound to adhere to; otherwise
we must be charged with scepticism, and concluded not
to know where to set our feet in matters of religion. Now,
so far as our faith herein is founded on scripture, every sense
we give of it must be agreeable thereunto; otherwise we do
as it were suppose that the word of God in one place destroys
what, in another, it establishes, which would be a great reflection
on that which is the standard and rule of our faith. I do
not hereby intend, that our sentiments are to be a rule of faith
to others, any farther than as they are evidently contained in,
or deduced from scripture: Yet that which we believe, as
thinking it to be the sense of scripture, is so far a rule to us,
that, whatever sense we give of any other scripture, must be
agreeable to it; or else, we must be content to acknowledge,
that we are mistaken in some of those things which we called
articles of faith, as founded thereon.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, No sense given of scripture, must be contrary to the
divine perfections: Thus, when human passions are ascribed
to God, such as grief, fear, desire, wrath, fury, indignation, <i>&amp;c.</i>
these are not to be explained, as when the same passions are
ascribed to men, in which sense they argue weakness and imperfection.
And when any phrase of scripture seems to represent
him defective in power; as in Jer. xiv. 9. ‘Why
shouldst thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that
cannot save?’ we are to understand it as a charge that would
be unjustly brought against God, if he did not appear in the
behalf of his people, by those who are disposed to reproach
and find fault with the dispensations of his providence: But,
since we have taken occasion, in explaining many scriptures
and doctrines founded upon them, to apply this rule; I shall
content myself, at present, with the bare mentioning of it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, We are to explain scripture in such a way, as that it
may have a tendency to promote practical godliness in all its
branches; which is the main end and design thereof. Many
instances might be given, in which this rule is to be applied;
as when we are said, in Rom. vii. 14. <i>not</i> to be <i>under the
law, but under grace</i>; we are not to understand this as though
we were discharged from an obligation to yield obedience to
whatever God commands; but either, as denoting our being
delivered from the condemning sentence of the law; or, from
the ceremonial law, to which the gospel-dispensation, which is
a display of the grace of God, is always opposed. And when
it is said in Eccl. vii. 16. ‘Be not righteous overmuch, neither
make thyself overwise: Why shouldst thou destroy thyself?’
We are not to understand thereby, that there is any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>danger of being too holy, or strict in the performance of religious
duties; but as forbidding an hypocritical appearing to be
more righteous than we are, or entertaining a proud and vain-glorious
conceit of our own righteousness, because we perform
some duties of religion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, there are other scriptures which are sometimes perverted,
as though they intimated, that prayer, or other religious
duties, were not incumbent on wicked men; as when
it is said, in Prov. xxi. 27. <i>The sacrifice of the wicked is an
abomination to the Lord</i>: And, chap. xxviii. 9. that his prayer
is so, or that he has nothing to do with those duties; because
it is said to such, in Psal. l. 16. <i>What hast thou to do
to declare my statutes, or, that thou shouldst take my covenant
in thy mouth.</i> But these scriptures do not imply, that they are
not obliged to perform religious duties; but, that it is contrary
to the holiness of God, and a great provocation to him
when they regard not the frame of spirit with which they
perform them, who draw nigh to him with their lips, when
their heart is far from him, or lay claim to the blessings of
the covenant of grace, while continuing in open hostility against
him. To apply this rule fully, would be to go through the whole
scripture, and to shew how all the great doctrines of religion
which are founded upon it, are conformed thereunto; But
this we have endeavoured to do in all those instances in
which we have had occasion to give the sense thereof; and
therefore shall content ourselves with this brief specimen, and
leave it to every one to improve upon it in his daily meditations,
in enquiring into the sense of scripture, in order to
his being farther established in that religion which is founded
thereon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLVIII., CLIX., CLX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLVIII.</span> <i>By whom is the word of God to be preached?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The word of God is to be preached only by such as
are sufficiently gifted, and also duly approved and called to
that office.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLIX.</span> <i>How is the word of God to be preached by
those that are called thereto?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> They that are called to labour in the ministry of the
word, are to preach sound doctrine, diligently; in season,
and out of season; plainly, not in the enticing words of
man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit, and
power, faithfully, making known the whole council of God;
wisely, applying themselves to the necessities and capacities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>of the hearers; zealously, with fervent love to God,
and the souls of his people; sincerely, aiming at his glory,
and their conversion, edification, and salvation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLX.</span> <i>What is required of those that hear the word
preached?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> It is required of those that hear the word preached,
that they attend upon it with diligence, preparation, and
prayer, examine what they hear, by the scripture, receive the
truth with faith, love, meekness, and readiness of mind, as
the word of God; meditate, and confer of it; hide it in
their heart, and bring forth the fruit of it in their lives.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having considered, what method we are to take, in our
private station, or capacity, to understand the word of
God; we have great reason to be thankful, that he has ordained
that it should be publicly preached, or explained, as a farther
means conducive to this end. And accordingly we are led,
in these answers, to shew, who they are that God has called to
this work; and how such ought to perform it; and with what
frame of spirit we ought to attend on it.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. The persons by whom the word of God is to be preached;
and these are only such, whom he has qualified with gifts
sufficient for it; and they ought also to be duly approved of,
when called hereunto, by those among whom the providence of
God directs them to exercise their ministry.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Concerning the qualifications which are necessary, in
those that are employed in preaching the gospel. Here it is to
be observed in general, that they must be sufficiently gifted for
it; which is so evident, that it would be unreasonable for any
one to deny it, since no one is to attempt any thing that he is
not able to perform; especially if it be a work of the highest
importance, and the unskilful managing thereof may have a
tendency to do prejudice to, rather than advance the interest
of Christ. It would be a reflection on the wisdom of a master,
to employ his servant in a work that he has no capacity for, or
entrust him with an affair that is like to miscarry in his hands.
In like manner, we are not to suppose that God calls any to
preach the gospel, but those whom he has, in some measure,
furnished for it; though, it is true, the best may say, as the
apostle does, <i>We are not sufficient of ourselves, to think any
thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God</i>: Yet he
adds, that they who are employed by him in this work, are
made <i>able ministers of the New-Testament</i>, 2 Cor. iii. 5, 6. It
is, indeed, a difficult matter to determine who are sufficiently
gifted for it; the work being so great and our natural and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>acquired endowments very small, if compared with it. But
that we may briefly consider this matter, it may be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That some qualifications are moral, without which, they
who preach the gospel, would be a reproach to it. These respect,
more especially, the conversation of those who are engaged
in this work, which ought to be blameless and exemplary;
not only inoffensive, but such as they, whom they are called to
instruct, may safely copy after. Thus the apostle makes a solemn
appeal, when he says, <i>Ye are witnesses, and God also, how
holily, and justly, and unblameably we behaved ourselves among
you that believe</i>, 1 Thess. ii. 10. And he advises the Corinthians
to be <i>followers of him</i>, 1 Cor. iv. 16. and commends the
church elsewhere, for conforming themselves to his example,
so far as it was agreeable to that of our Saviour, 1 Thess. i. 6.
in which respect alone the best of men are to be followed, 1
Cor. xi. 1. Now this supposes that they have that which we
call the moral qualifications, necessary to the work of the ministry,
without which, a person will do more hurt, by his example,
than he can do good by his doctrine; inasmuch as he will lay a
stumbling-block in the way of Christians, who would be ready
to say, as the apostle does to some of those who were teachers
among the Jews; <i>Thou which teachest another, teachest thou
not thyself?</i> Rom. ii. 21. or, dost thou live in the practice of
those crimes, which thou condemnest in others, and exhortest
them to avoid? This qualification therefore, must be supposed
to be necessary; and, indeed, an experimental knowledge of divine
truths, will greatly furnish them to communicate the same
to others, and spirit them, with zeal, in using their utmost endeavours,
that they may be made partakers of the same experiences
which they themselves, have been favoured with. Nevertheless,
we are not to suppose that this alone will warrant
a person’s engaging in the work of the ministry; for then every
one who has experienced the grace of God, might attempt it,
how unable soever he be to manage it to the glory of God, and
the edification of the church. Therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) There are other qualifications more directly subservient
hereunto. These the apostle speaks of, when he describes a
gospel-minister as one who is <i>apt to teach</i>, 1 Tim. iii. 2. and
able <i>rightly to divide the word of truth</i>, 2 Tim. ii. 15. and, by
<i>sound doctrine</i>, to exhort and <i>convince gainsayers</i>, Tit. i. 9.
They who take upon them to explain scripture, and apply it
to the consciences of men, ought, certainly, with great diligence
and hard study, to use their utmost endeavours to understand
it. And to this we may add, that they ought to be able
to reason, or infer just consequences from it; whereby they
may appear to be well versed in those great doctrines, on
which our faith and religion is founded. This, indeed, must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>be confessed to be a work of difficulty; and, they who think
themselves best furnished in this respect, will have reason to
conclude, as the apostle says, that they <i>know but in part, and
prophesy in part</i>, 1 Cor. xiii. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this we may add, that there are various parts of learning,
that may be reckoned, in some respects, ornamental, which
would tend to secure him that preaches the gospel from contempt;
and others, that are more immediately subservient to
our understanding scripture, namely, a being well acquainted
with those languages, in which the Old and New Testament
were written, and able to make critical remarks on the style
and mode of expression used in each of them, and a being conversant
in the writings of those, whether in our own or other
languages, who have clearly and judiciously explained the doctrines
of the gospel, or led us into the knowledge of those
things that have a tendency to illustrate them. And, inasmuch
as preaching contains in it an address to the judgments
and consciences of men, I cannot but reckon it a qualification
necessary in order hereunto, that all those parts of learning
that have a tendency to enlarge the reasoning faculties, or help
us to see the connexion or dependence of one thing upon another,
should be attended to, that we may hereby be fitted to
convey our ideas with judgment and method. These qualifications
are to be acquired. We pass by those that are natural,
to wit, a sufficient degree of parts, and such an elocution as is
necessary for those who are to speak to the edification of an
audience, without which all other endeavours to furnish themselves
for this work, will be to very little purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. They, by whom the word of God is to be preached, are
to be duly approved and called to that office. A person may
think himself qualified for it without sufficient ground; therefore
this matter ought to be submitted to the judgment of others,
by whose approbation he is to engage in this work. The
first thing that is to be enquired into, is; whether he is called
to it by God, not only by his providence, which opens a door
for his preaching the gospel, but by the success which he is
pleased to grant to his endeavours, in order to his being duly
qualified for it? Notwithstanding, since persons may be mistaken,
and think they have a divine call hereunto, when they
have not; it is necessary that they should be approved by those
who are sufficient judges of this matter, that they may not be
exposed to temptation, so as to engage in a work which they
are not deemed sufficient for. Not that it is in the power of
ministers, or churches, especially according to the present situation
of things, to hinder an unqualified person who has too
high thoughts of his own abilities, from preaching to a number
of people that is disposed to hear him; yet no one is bound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>or ought, in prudence, or faithfulness to God or man, to own
any to be a minister, whose gifts do not render him fit to be
approved; nor, on the other hand, can any judgment be passed
on this matter, without sufficient acquaintance or conversation
with him, that thereby it may be known whether he be a
workman that needeth not to be ashamed, and able rightly to
divide the word of truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here, I think, there is some difference between the approbation
that ought to be passed on those who first engage in the
work of preaching, and the call to the pastoral office; the latter
supposes the former; and therefore a person ought first to
be approved of, as fit to preach the gospel, in the opinion of
those who are allowed to be competent judges hereof, which is
necessary to his entrance on that work with reputation and acceptance;
without which, he is to stand and fall to his own
master, and acquiesce in the approbation of those who are willing
to sit under his ministry; while others are not bound (as
being destitute of sufficient evidence) to conclude him furnished
for, or called to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the call to the pastoral office; though no one has a
right to impose pastors on churches; yet it is the indispensible
duty of every church not barely to enquire; whether the
person, whom they have a desire to call to that office, be such
an one as is approved by the greater number of them; but,
whether the step they are taking herein, is such as has a tendency
to secure their reputation as a church of Christ, without
exposing them to the just blame and censure of others,
who are in the same faith and order with themselves? that
they may do nothing that is in the least offensive, or that has
a tendency to weaken the interest of Christ in his churches.
It is true, no one can put a stop to their proceeding, if they
are resolved to set over them one that is not only scandalous
in his conversation, but inclined to preach what is subversive
of the fundamental articles of our faith; yet they cannot hereby
act as a church that has obtained mercy from God to be
faithful, or engage in this important work with judgment. It
is therefore expedient, that churches should set over them ministers
approved by others as sound in the faith, as well as
reckoned, by themselves, able to preach to their edification;
and, in order hereunto, it is expedient that some ministers, and
members of other churches, should be present at their investiture
in that office, to which they have called them, not barely
as being witnesses of their faith and order, in common with
the whole assembly, but as testifying hereby their approbation
of their proceedings, and giving ground to the world to conclude,
that that person, whom they have called, is owned by
others, as well as themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>And, in order thereunto, it is necessary that ministers, who
are to join in begging the blessing of God on their proceedings,
and giving a word of exhortation to them, should be satisfied
concerning the fitness of him whom the church has called to
that office; which is supposed by their being present, and bearing
their respective parts therein. This, I think, is intended
by that expression of the apostle, in which he advises Timothy,
<i>to lay hands suddenly on no man; nor to be partaker of other
men’s sins; but to keep himself pure</i>, 1 Tim. v. 22. that is,
without guilt, as being active in approving those that he ought
not to approve of. I do not, by this, take the power out of
the hands of the church, of setting a pastor over themselves;
but only hereby argue the expediency of their consulting the
honour of the gospel herein, and acting so, as that they may
have the approbation of other churches in that solemnity.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We are now to consider how the word of God is to be
preached by those who are qualified, approved, and called thereunto;
and that, both as to doctrines to be insisted on, and the
manner in which they are to be delivered.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. What they are to preach, ought to be sound doctrine, and
that not barely what is deemed to be so by him that preaches
it; since there is scarce any one but thinks himself sound in
the faith, how remote soever his sentiments may be from the
true intent and meaning of the word of God. But hereby we
understand those doctrines which are so called by the apostle,
Tit. i. 9. such as are agreeable to that <i>form of sound words</i>
which is transmitted to us by divine inspiration, 2 Tim. i. 13.
<i>the doctrine which is according to godliness</i>, 1 Tim. vi. 3. as
having a tendency to recommend and promote it. This is styled
elsewhere, <i>The faith once delivered to the saints</i>; which is
not only to be preached, but <i>earnestly contended for</i>, Jude, ver.
3. These are such doctrines as have a tendency to advance the
glory of God, and do good to the souls of men, that are relished
and savoured by sincere Christians, who know the truth, as
it is in Jesus; and are <i>nourished up</i>, as the apostle says, <i>in the
words of faith and of good doctrine</i>, 1 Tim. iv. 6. This, as
it has a peculiar reference to the gospel, and the way of salvation
contained therein, is called <i>preaching Christ</i>, Col. i. 18.
or a <i>determining to know nothing</i>; that is, to appear to know,
or to discover nothing, <i>save Jesus Christ and him crucified</i>, 1
Cor. ii. 2. or deliver nothing but what tends to set forth the
person and offices of Christ, either directly, or in its remote
tendency thereunto. Our Saviour advises the church, to <i>take
heed what they hear</i>, Mark iv. 24. as signifying, that we are
to receive no doctrines but what are agreeable to the gospel.
And this is a sufficient intimation that such only are to be
preached, the contrary to which method of preaching, the apostle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>calls <i>perverting the gospel of Christ</i>; and adds, that <i>though
we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel than that
which we have preached, let him be accursed</i>, Gal. i. 7, 8. These
are the only doctrines that God will own, because they tend to
set forth his perfections, as they were at first communicated by
him for that end.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are now to consider the manner in which these doctrines
are to be preached. This is laid down in several heads,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Diligently and constantly, in season and out of season,
considering this work as the main business of life, that which
a minister is to <i>give himself wholly to</i>, 1 Tim. iv. 15. and all
his studies are to be subservient to this end. He is to rejoice
in all opportunities, in which he may lead those whom he is
called to minister to, in the way to heaven, and be willing to
lay out his strength, and those abilities which God has given
him, to his glory. Thus the apostle says, <i>I would very gladly
spend, and be spent for you</i>, 2 Cor. xii. 14. This argues, that
the word is not barely to be preached occasionally, as though
it were to be hid from the world, or only imparted, when the
leisure or inclination of those who are called thereto, will admit
of it. The character which the apostle gives of gospel-ministers,
is, that they <i>watch for the souls of those to whom
they minister</i>; that is, they wait for the best and fittest seasons
to inculcate divine truths to them. This is particularly expressed
<i>by preaching the word</i>, and <i>being instant in season, and
out of season, reproving, rebuking, and exhorting with all long-suffering
and doctrine</i>, 2 Tim. iv. 2. which implies, that it
ought to be preached, not only on that day, which God has
sanctified for public worship, of which preaching is a part; but
on all occasions, when they are apprehensive that the people
are desirous to receive and hear it.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) It is to be preached plainly. Thus the apostle says,
<i>We use great plainness of speech</i>, 2 Cor. iii. 12. This method
of preaching is inconsistent with the using unintelligible expressions:
which neither they nor their hearers well understand.
The style ought to be familiar, and adapted to the
meanest capacities; which may be done without exposing it
to contempt. And it is particularly observed, that it ought
not to be, <i>in the enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration
of the Spirit and of power</i>; as the apostle says concerning
his method of preaching, 1 Cor. ii. 14. The great design
hereof, is, not to please the ear with well turned periods,
or rhetorical expressions, or an affectation of shewing skill in
human learning, in those instances in which it is not directly
adapted to edification, or rendered subservient to the explaining
of scripture. A demonstrative way of preaching, is not,
indeed, opposed to this plainness that is here intended but it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>the <i>demonstration of the Spirit</i>; which, though it differs from
that which the apostles were favoured with (who were led into
the doctrines they preached, by immediate inspiration;) yet
we are to endeavour to prove, by strength of argument, that
what we deliver is agreeable to the mind and will of God therein;
and yet to do this with that plainness of address, as those
who desire to awaken the consciences of men, and give them
the fullest conviction, proving from the scripture, that what we
say is true. This account the apostle gives of his ministry, 2
Cor. iv. 2. as what was most adapted to answer the valuable
ends thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) The word of God is to be preached faithfully; which
supposes that they who are called to this work, have the souls
of those whom they preach to, committed to their care; so that,
if they perish for want of due instruction, they are, for this neglect,
found guilty before God. Thus God says to the prophet,
<i>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house Israel</i>,
Ezek. iii. 17, &amp;c. and therefore he was to <i>give them
warning</i>, which, if he did, he <i>delivered his</i> own <i>soul</i>; but if
not, God intimates to him that <i>their blood should be required
at his hand</i>. This supposes that they are accountable to God
for the doctrines they deliver; for which reason the apostle
speaks of them, as <i>stewards of the mysteries of God</i>, of whom
it was <i>required that</i> they should <i>be found faithful</i>, 1 Cor. iv.
1, 2. and, as a particular instance thereof, he makes a solemn
appeal to the elders of the church of Ephesus, that he had <i>kept
back nothing that was profitable unto them</i>, nor <i>shunned to declare
all the counsel of God</i>, Acts xx. 27. This faithfulness in
the exercise of the ministry, is opposed to their having respect
of persons from some obligation which they are laid under to
them, or the prospect of some advantage that they expect from
them, which makes them sparing in reproving those who are
blame-worthy, for fear of giving offence, or losing their friendship.
It is also opposed to preaching those doctrines which
are suited to the humours and corruptions of men, and neglecting
to insist on the most necessary and important truths; because
they apprehend that they will be entertained with disgust.
This is to act as though their main design were to
please men rather than God. And it is very remote from the
conduct of the prophet Isaiah; who, when he was informed
that the people desired that the <i>prophets</i> would <i>prophesy smooth
things</i> to them, and <i>cause the holy one of Israel to cease from
before them</i>, Isa. xxx. 10, 11. he takes occasion to represent
God as the holy one of Israel, in the following words, and to
denounce the judgments which he would bring upon them,
how unwilling soever they were to receive this doctrine from
him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>And, to this we may add, that they are to be reckoned no
other than unfaithful in their method of preaching, who, under
a pretence of pressing the observance of moral duties, set aside
the great doctrines of faith in Christ, and justification by his
righteousness, which is the only foundation of our acceptance
in his sight. Concerning which we may say, without being
supposed to have light thoughts of moral virtue; that the one
ought, in no wise to exclude the other. Neither can they be
reckoned faithful, who shun to declare those important truths,
on which the glory of God, and the comfort of his people depend;
and therefore, if morality be rightly preached, it ought
to be inculcated from evangelical motives, and connected with
other truths that have a tendency more directly to set forth the
Mediator’s glory; which ought not to be laid aside as controverted
doctrines, which all cannot acquiesce in, as supposing
that the tempers, or rather the ignorance and corruption of men,
will not bear them.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) The word of God is to be preached wisely. This wisdom
consists,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] In the choice of those subjects, that have the greatest
tendency to promote the interest of Christ, and the good of
mankind in general. There are many doctrines which must
be allowed to be true, that are not of equal importance with
others; nor so much adapted to promote the work of salvation,
and the glory of God therein. There are some doctrines which
the apostle calls <i>the present truth</i>, 2 Pet. i. 12. in which he instructs
those to whom he writes. Accordingly, those truths
are to be frequently inculcated, which are most opposite to the
dictates of corrupt nature and carnal reason; because of their
holiness, spirituality, beauty, and glory. Again, those doctrines
are to be explained and supported by the most solid and judicious
methods of reasoning, which are very much perverted
and undermined by the subtle enemies of our salvation. And
whatever truth is necessary to be known, as subservient to godliness,
which multitudes are ignorant of, this is to be frequently
insisted on, that they may not be destroyed for lack of knowledge;
and those duties, which we are most prone to neglect,
in which the life and power of religion discovers itself, these
are to be inculcated as a means to promote practical godliness.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] The wisdom of those that preach the gospel farther appears,
in suiting their discourses to the capacities of their hearers;
of whom, it must be supposed,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That some are ignorant and weak in the faith who cannot
easily take in those truths that are, with much more ease,
apprehended and received by others; for their sake the word
of God is to be preached with the greatest plainness and familiarity
of style. Thus the apostle speaks of some who needed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>to be <i>fed with milk</i>, being <i>unskilful in the word of righteousness</i>,
and, as it were, <i>babes</i> in knowledge, Heb. v. 12-14. whereas
others, that he compares to <i>strong men</i>, were fed with <i>meat</i>,
that was agreeable to them. By which he doth not intend, as
I apprehend, a difference of doctrines, as though some were
to have nothing preached to them but moral duties: while
others were to have the doctrines of justification, and faith in
Christ, &amp;c. preached to them; but rather a different way of
managing them, respecting the closeness and connexion of
those methods of reasoning by which they are established
which some are better able to improve and receive advantage
by, than others.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, Some must be supposed to be wavering, and in danger
of being perverted from the faith of the gospel; for their
sakes the most strong and cogent arguments are to be made
use of, and well managed, in order to their establishment therein,
and those objections that are generally brought against it,
answered.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Others are lukewarm and indifferent in matters of religion;
these need to have awakening truths, insisted on with
great seriousness and affection, suited to the occasion thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, Others are assaulted with temptations, and subject to
many doubts and fears, about the state of their souls, and the
truth of grace; or, it may be, their consciences are burdened
with some scruples, about the lawfulness or expediency of
things, and some hesitation of mind, whether what they engage
in is a sin or duty. Now, that the word may be adapted
to their condition, the wiles of Satan are to be discovered,
cases of conscience resolved, evidences of the truth of grace,
or the marks of sincerity and hypocrisy are to be plainly laid
down, and the fulness, freeness, and riches of divine grace,
through a Mediator, to be set forth as the only expedient to
fence them against their doubts and fears, and keep them from,
giving way to despair.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>5thly</i>, The word of God is to be preached zealously, with
fervent love to God, and the souls of his people. Thus it is
said, in Acts xviii. 25. concerning Apollos, that <i>being fervent
in the Spirit, he spake and taught diligently in the things of
the Lord</i>. This zeal doth not consist in a passionate, furious
address, arising from personal pique and prejudice; or, in exposing
men for their weakness; or expressing an undue resentment
of some injuries received from them; but it is such a
zeal, that is consistent with fervent love to God, and the souls
of men. The love which is to be expressed to God, discovers
itself, in the concern they have for the advancing his truth,
name, and glory, and the promoting his interest in the world,
which is infinitely preferable to all other interests; and their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>love to the souls of men induceth them to preach to them, as
considering that they have not only the same nature in common
with themselves, in which they must either be happy or
miserable, for ever: But they are liable to the same infirmities,
difficulties, dangers, and spiritual enemies, which should incline
those that preach the gospel, to express the greatest sympathy
with them in their troubles, while they are using their utmost
endeavours to help them in their way to heaven. They are to
be considered as being, by nature, in a lost, undone condition;
and the success of the gospel, as being the only means to prevent
their perishing for ever. And, with respect to those, in
whom the word of God is made effectual for their conversion,
ministers are to endeavour to build them up in their holy faith,
as those who, they hope, will be their <i>crown of rejoicing in
the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, at his coming</i>, 1 Thess.
ii. 19.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>6thly</i>, The word is to be preached sincerely, aiming at the
glory of God, and the conversion, edification, and salvation of
his people. Accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, Ministers must firmly believe the doctrines they deliver,
and not preach them because they are the generally-received
opinion of the churches; for that is hardly consistent with
sincerity; at least, it argues a great deal of weakness, or want
of judgment, as though they were wavering about those important
truths, which they think in compliance with custom,
they are obliged to communicate.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, They must have no by and unwarrantable ends in
preaching, namely, the gaining the esteem of men, or promoting
their own secular interest. Though what the apostle says
be true, that the <i>labourer is worthy of his hire</i>, and, <i>they that
preach the gospel, must live of the gospel</i>, 1 Cor. ix. 14. Yet
this ought not to be the principal end inducing them hereunto;
for that is like what is threatened against the remains of the
house of Eli, who were exposed to such a servile and mercenary
temper, as to <i>crouch for a piece of silver; and to say, put
me, I pray thee, into one of the priest’s offices, that I may eat
a piece of bread</i>, 1 Sam. ii. 36. The glory of God is to be the
principal end of the ministry; and, accordingly, they are to endeavour
to approve themselves to him in the whole of their
conduct therein. Thus the apostle speaks of himself, as <i>not
seeking to please men; which, if I do</i>, says he, <i>I should not be
the servant of Christ</i>, Gal. i. 10. This method of preaching
will be a means to beget, in the minds of men, the highest esteem
of him. And, more especially, the glory of God is to be
set forth as it shines in the face of Jesus Christ, or discovers
itself in the work of salvation, brought about by him. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>is the only expedient to render the preaching of the gospel conducive
to answer the most valuable ends.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, inasmuch as next to the glory of God, the conversion,
edification, and salvation of men, is to be aimed at; such a
method of preaching is to be used, as is best adapted hereunto.
Therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>1st</i>,) In order to the promoting the conversion of sinners,
they are to be led into a sense of their guilt and misery, while
in an unconverted state; together with the necessity of their
believing on Christ, to the salvation of the soul; as also the
methods prescribed in the gospel for their recovery, and escaping
the wrath they are liable to. They are to be made acquainted
with the gospel-call, in which sinners are invited to
come to Christ, and his willingness to receive all that repent
and believe in him. And, since this is the peculiar work of
the Spirit, they are to pray and hope for his grace, to give success
to his ordinances, in which they wait for his salvation.
And if God is pleased to set home these truths on the consciences
of men, and enable them to comply with this call, then
the word is preached in a right manner, and their labour is not
in vain in the Lord.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>2dly</i>,) As for those who are converted, their farther establishment,
and edification in Christ is designed, together with
the increase of the work of grace that is begun in them. Accordingly
they are to be told of the imperfection of their present
state, and what is still lacking to fill up the measure of
their faith and obedience; and they are to be warned of the
assaults that they are like to meet with from their spiritual enemies,
of the wiles and devices of Satan, to interrupt the actings
of grace, overthrow their confidence, or disturb their peace.
They are also to be directed how they may improve the redemption
purchased by Christ, for the mortifying of sin, obtaining
the victory over temptation, and increasing their faith
in him. And, in addressing themselves to them, they are to
explain difficult scriptures, that they may grow in knowledge,
and discover to them the evidences of the strength and weakness
of grace, tending to promote the one, and prevent the other.
Also, the promises of the gospel are to be applied to them
for their encouragement, and they excited to go on in the ways
of God, depending on, and deriving strength from Christ, for
the carrying on the work that is begun in them. This leads
us to consider what is contained in the last of the answers we
are explaining, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>III. What is the hearer’s duty, who desires to receive spiritual
advantage by the word preached; and this respects his
behaviour before, in, and after his hearing the word.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Before we hear the word, we are to endeavour to prepare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>ourselves for the solemn work which we are to engage in, duly
considering how we need instruction, or, at least, to have
truths brought to our remembrance, and impressed on our
hearts; as also, that this is an ordinance which God has instituted
for that purpose; and, as it is instamped with his authority,
so we may depend on it, that his eye will be upon us, to
observe our frame of spirit under the word. And we ought
to have an awful sense of his perfections, to excite in us an holy
reverence, and the exercise of other graces, necessary to our
engaging in this duty, in a right manner; and inasmuch as these
are God’s gift, we are to be very importunate with him in
prayer for them. And, among other things, we are to desire
that he would assist his ministers in preaching the word; so
that what shall be delivered by them, may be agreeable to his
mind and will; and, that this may be done in such a way, that
it may recommend itself to the consciences of those that hear
it; that their understandings may be enlightened, and they enabled
to receive it with faith and love; and that all those corruptions,
or temptations, that hinder the success thereof, may
be prevented. These, and such-like things are to be desired
of God in prayer; not only for ourselves in particular, but for
all those who shall be engaged with us in this ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might here consider the arguments or pleas that we may
make use of, with relation hereunto, viz. such as are taken
from those promises which God has made of his presence with
his people, when engaged in public worship, Exod. xx. 24.
Matt. xviii. 20. We may also plead the insufficiency of man’s
instructions, without the Spirit’s teaching, or leading us into
all truth; and that Christ has promised that his Spirit shall be
given to his people for this end, John xvi. 13, 14. We may
also plead our own inability to hear the word of God in a right
manner, and the violent efforts that are made by our corrupt
nature, to hinder our receiving advantage by it, and what endeavours
Satan often uses in conjunction with it, by which
means, as our Saviour expresses it in the parable, Matt. xiii.
19. he <i>catches away</i> that seed which was sown in the heart;
whereby it will become unfruitful. And to this we may add,
the afflictive sense we have of the ill consequences which will
attend our hearing the word, and not profiting by it, whereby
the soul is left worse than it was before; as the apostle says,
that he was, in the course of his ministry, to some, the <i>saviour
of death unto death</i>, 2 Cor. ii. 16. We may also plead the glory
that will redound to God, by the displays of his grace, in
making the word effectual to salvation, and the great honour
he hereby puts on his own institution, inasmuch as, herein, he
sets his seal thereunto. We may also plead that this is God’s
usual way in which he dispenses his grace, and accordingly he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>has encouraged us, to hope and wait for it therein; and, that
multitudes of his saints, both in earth and heaven, have experienced
his presence with them under the word; whereby they
were first enabled to believe in Christ, and afterwards established
more and more in that grace, which they were made
partakers of at first from him. Therefore we hope and trust
that we may be admitted to participate of the same privilege.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. There are several duties required of us in hearing the
word; particularly we are to try the doctrines that are delivered,
whether they are agreeable unto, and founded on scripture,
that we may not be imposed upon by the errors of men,
instead of the truths of God. Moreover, we are to endeavour
to exercise those graces that are suitable to the work we
are engaged in; and, as the apostle says, <i>mix the word with
faith</i>, 2 Cor. ii. 16. and express the highest love and esteem
for the glorious truths which are contained therein, discovering
the greatest readiness to yield obedience to every thing God
commands, and thankfulness for whatever he has promised to
us. Moreover we are to hear the word with a particular application
of it to our own condition, whether it be in a way of
admonition, reproof, exhortation or encouragement, and to see
how much we are concerned to improve it, to our spiritual
advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We are now to consider those duties which are to be
performed by us, after we have heard the word preached.
Some of these require privacy or retirement from the world;
by which means we may meditate on, digest, and apply what
we have heard; and, together with this, examine ourselves,
and thereby take a view of our behaviour, whilst we have
been engaged in public worship, in order to our being humbled
for sins committed, or thankful for grace received. But
this having been particularly considered under another answer,
relating to our sanctifying the Sabbath in the evening thereof<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a>,
I shall pass it over at present.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another duty incumbent on us, after we have heard
the word, which may conduce to the spiritual advantage of
others, as it is to be the subject of our conversation; upon
which account we are to take occasion to observe the excellency,
beauty, and glory of divine truths, that are communicated
in scripture: We are to hear the word, not merely as critics,
making our remarks on the elegancy of style, the fluency of
expression, or other gifts, which we are ready to applaud in
the preacher, on the one hand, nor exposing and censuring the
defects which we have observed in his method of address, on
the other. We are rather to take notice of the suitableness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the truths delivered to the condition of mankind in general,
or our own in particular, and observe how consonant the word
preached has been to the holy scriptures, the standard of truth,
and the agreement thereof, with the experiences of God’s people.
We are also to take occasion from hence, to enquire into
the meaning of scripture, especially some particular texts that
have been insisted on, or, in some measure, explained, in the
preaching of the word, in order to our farther information and
improvement in the knowledge of divine things.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last thing that is observed in this answer, is, that after
having heard the word of God, we are to endeavour to bring
forth the fruit of it in our lives: This consists in a conversation
becoming the gospel; and being induced hereby to <i>deny
ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously,
and godly in this present world</i>, Tit. ii. 13. And we ought to
express a becoming zeal for divine truths, defending them when
opposed, and endeavouring to establish others therein; that so
we may recommend religion to them, as that which is the most
solid foundation for peace, and leads to universal holiness, that
hereby we may adorn the doctrine of God, our Saviour, in all
things.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXI., CLXII., CLXIII., CLXIV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXI.</span> <i>How doth the sacraments become effectual
means of salvation?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sacraments become effectual means of salvation;
not by any power in themselves, or any virtue derived
from the piety and intention of him by whom they are administered;
but only by the working of the Holy Ghost,
and the blessing of Christ, by whom they are instituted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXII.</span> <i>What is a sacrament?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> A sacrament is an holy ordinance, instituted by Christ
in his church, to signify, seal, and exhibit, unto those that
are within the covenant of grace, the benefits of his mediation;
to strengthen and increase their faith, and all other
graces; to oblige them to obedience; to testify and cherish
their love and communion one with another, and to distinguish
them from those that are without.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXIII.</span> <i>What are the parts of a sacrament?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The parts of a sacrament are two; the one an outward
and sensible sign, used according to Christ’s own appointment;
the other, an inward and spiritual grace, thereby
signified.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXIV.</span> <i>How many sacraments hath Christ instituted
in his church, under the New Testament?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Under the New Testament Christ hath instituted in
his church only two sacraments; Baptism, and the Lord’s
Supper.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has pleased God, in setting forth the glory of his wisdom
and sovereignty to impart his mind and will to man, various
ways, besides the discovery which he makes of himself
in the dispensations of his providence. These are, more especially,
reducible to two general heads, viz. his making it known
by words, which is the more plain and common way by which
we are led into the knowledge of divine truths; or else, by
visible signs, which are sometimes called types, figures, or sacraments.
The former of these we have already insisted on;
the latter we now proceed to consider. And, in order hereunto,
we are first to explain the nature, and shew what are the
parts of a sacrament, as we have an account thereof in the two
last of these answers; and then consider, how the sacraments
become effectual means of salvation, as contained in the first,
of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Concerning the nature and parts of a sacrament: In order
to our understanding whereof, we shall consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The meaning of the word. It is certain, that the word
<i>sacrament</i> is not to be found in scripture, though the thing intended
thereby, is expressed in other words; and, for this reason,
some have scrupled the use of it, and choose rather to
make use of other phrases more agreeable to the scripture
mode of speaking: But, though we are not to hold any doctrine
that is not founded on scripture; yet those which are
contained therein, may be explained in our own words, provided
they are consonant thereunto. The Greek church knew
nothing of the word <i>sacrament</i>, it being of a Latin original;
but, instead thereof, used the word <i>mystery</i>; thereby signifying,
that there is in the sacraments, besides the outward and
visible signs, some secret or hidden mystery signified thereby.
The Latin church used the word <i>sacrament</i>, not only as signifying
something that is sacred; but as denoting, that thereby
they were bound as with an oath, to be the Lord’s; as the
Psalmist says, <i>I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will
keep thy righteous judgments</i>, Psal. cxix. 106. and God, by the
prophet, says, <i>Unto me every knee shall bow, and every tongue
shall swear</i>, Isa. xlv. 23.</p>

<p class='c006'>The word Sacrament was used, indeed, by the Romans, to
signify that oath which the soldiers took, to be true and faithful
to their general, and to fight courageously under his banner;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>but the primitive Christians signified hereby, that, when
they were called to suffer for Christ, which was, as it were, a
fighting under his banner, they did in this ordinance, as it
were, take an oath to him, expressing their obligation not to
desert his cause. Now, since this is agreeable to the end and
design of a sacrament, whatever be the first original of the use
of the word, I think we have no reason to scruple the using
of it, though it be not found in scripture: Nevertheless, Christians
ought not to contend, or be angry with one another about
this matter, it being of no great importance, if we adhere stedfastly
to the explication given thereof in scripture.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>2. We shall now consider the nature of a sacrament, as
described in one of the answers we are explaining. And
here,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) It is observed, concerning it, that it is an holy ordinance,
instituted by Christ. What we are to understand by
an ordinance, and its being founded on a divine institution,
which is our only warrant to engage therein, has been before
considered; and, indeed, every duty that is to be performed
by God’s express command, which he has designed to be a
pledge of his presence, and a means of grace, is a branch of
religious worship, and may be truly styled an holy ordinance.
Now, that the sacraments are founded on Christ’s institution,
is very evident from scripture. Thus he commanded his apostles,
to <i>baptize all nations</i>, Matt. xxviii. 19. and, as to the sacrament
of the Lord’s supper, he commanded them to <i>do</i> what
is contained therein, <i>in remembrance of him</i>, Matt. xxvi. 26,
27. compared with 1 Cor. xi. 24, 25.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The persons, for whom the sacraments were instituted,
are the church, who stand in an external covenant-relation to
God, and, as the apostle says, are <i>called to be saints</i>, Rom. i. 7.
It is to them, more especially, that Christ, when he ascended
up on high, gave ministers, as a token of his regard to them,
that hereby they may be edified, who are styled <i>his body</i>, Eph.
iv. 16. And, though these ministers are authorized to preach
the gospel to all nations, which is necessary for the gathering
churches out of the world; yet they are never ordered to administer
the sacraments to all nations, nor, indeed, to any, especially
the sacrament of the Lord’s supper, till they profess
subjection to Christ, and thereby join together in the fellowship
of the gospel. As the sacraments under the Old Testament
dispensation, were to be administered to none but the
church of the Jews, the only people in the world that professed
the true religion; so, under the gospel dispensation, none
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>have a right to sacraments but those who are therein professedly
devoted to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We are now to consider the matter of the sacraments,
which is set forth in general terms; and it is also called in one
of the answers we are explaining, the parts of a sacrament;
these are an outward and visible sign, and an inward and spiritual
grace, signified thereby; or, as it is otherwise expressed,
it signifies, seals, and exhibits to those who are within the covenant
of grace, the benefits of Christ’s mediation. These
words are often used, but not so well explained as might be
desired.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) It is called a sign, in which, by a visible action, some
spiritual benefits are signified: This is undoubtedly true; and
it is a reproach cast on God’s holy institutions, in some who
deny sacraments to be divine ordinances, when they style them
all carnal ordinances, beggarly elements, or a re-establishing
the ceremonial law, without distinguishing between significant
signs, that were formerly ordinances to the Jewish church, but
are now abolished; and those that Christ hath given to the
gospel church. In this idea of the sacraments, we must consider,
that they agree, in some things, with the preaching of the
word; namely, that hereby Christ and his benefits, are set
forth as objects of our faith; and the same ends are desired
and attained by both, <i>viz.</i> our being affected with, and making
a right improvement of the blessings purchased by him, together
with our enjoying communion with him; and they are,
both of them, sacred ordinances, instituted by Christ, and
therefore to be attended on in an holy manner: But, on the
other hand, they differ, with respect to the way or means by
which Christ and his benefits are set forth; inasmuch, as in the
preaching of the word, there is a narration of what he hath
done and suffered; and, upon this account the apostle says,
<i>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God</i>,
Rom. x. 17. whereas, in the sacraments, there is a representation
thereof by signs; in which case we may apply the words
of the prophet, <i>Mine eye afflicteth mine heart</i>, Lam. iii. 51. as
there is the external symbol of Christ’s dying love, which is
an inducement to us to love him again. They also differ,
in that the sacraments are not only designed to instruct;
but, by our act and deed, we signify our engagement to be
the Lord’s.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The sacraments are also said to seal the blessings that
they signify; and accordingly they are called, not only signs,
but seals. It is a difficult matter to explain, and clearly to
state the difference between these two words, or to shew what
is contained in a seal, that is not in a sign: Some think that
it is a distinction without a difference. The principal ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>which most divines proceed upon, when they distinguish between
them is, what we read in Rom. iv. 11. in which the
apostle, speaking concerning Abraham, says, <i>he received the
sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of faith</i><a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a>. But
the same thing might have been affirmed concerning it, or any
other significant ordinance, if the words sign and seal were supposed
to be of the like import; for it is not said he received
the ordinance of circumcision, which is not only a sign, but a
seal; but he received that which was a sign, or a seal of the
blessing about which his faith was conversant. However, that
we may explain this matter, without laying aside those words
that are commonly used and distinguished in treating on this
subject, it may be observed, that a sign is generally understood
as importing any thing that hath a tendency to signify or confirm
something that is transacted, or designed to be published,
and made visible: Accordingly some signs have a natural
tendency to signify the things intended by them; as the regular
beating of the pulse is a sign of health, smoke the sign of
fire. And other things not only signify, but represent that
which they give us an idea of, by some similitude that there
is therein, as the picture doth its original. Other things only
signify as they are ordained or designed for that use, by custom
or appointment; thus, in civil matters, a staff is a sign of
power to exercise an office; the seal of a bond, or conveyance,
is the sign of a right that is therein conveyed, or made
over to another to possess: It is in this respect that the sacraments
are signs of the covenant of grace: They do not naturally
represent Christ and his benefits; but they signify them,
by divine appointment.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, on the other hand, a seal, according to the most common
acceptation of the word, imports a confirming sign<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a>:
Yet we must take heed that we do not, in compliance with
custom, contain more in our ideas of this word, than is agreeable
to the analogy of faith: Therefore, let it be considered,
that the principal method God hath taken for the confirming
our faith in the benefits of Christ’s redemption, is, his own
truth and faithfulness, whereby the heirs of salvation <i>have
strong consolation</i>, Heb. iv. 17, 18. or else the internal testimony
of the Spirit of God in our hearts. The former is an objective
means of confirmation, and the latter a subjective; and
this the apostle calls our <i>being established in Christ, and sealed,
having the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts</i>, 2 Cor. i. 21, 23.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is not the sense in which we are to understand the word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>as applied to the sacraments; since if we call them confirming
seals, we intend nothing else hereby, but that God has, to the
promises that are given to us in his word, added these ordinances;
not only to bring to mind this great doctrine, that
Christ has redeemed his people by his blood; but to assure
them, that they who believe in him, shall be made partakers of
this blessing; so that these ordinances are a pledge thereof to
them, in which respect God has set his seal, whereby, in an
objective way, he gives believers to understand, that Christ,
and his benefits, are theirs; and they are obliged, at the same
time, by faith, as well as in an external and visible manner, to
signify their compliance with his covenant, which we may call
their setting to their seal that God is true; as we may allude
to that expression of our Saviour, <i>He that hath received his
testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true</i>, John iii. 33.
The sacraments are God’s seals, as they are ordinances given
by him for the confirmation of our faith, that he would be our
covenant-God; and they are our seals, or we set our seal
thereunto, when we visibly profess, which ought to be done
also by faith, that we give up ourselves to him, to be his people,
and desire to be made partakers of the benefits which
Christ hath purchased, in his own way. Thus concerning the
sacraments, as being signs and seals of the covenant of grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another expression, used in this answer, that needs
a little explication; namely, when the sacraments are said, not
only to signify and seal, but to exhibit the benefits of Christ’s
mediation. <i>To exhibit</i>, sometimes signifies to shew, or present
to our view; which word, if it be so understood in this place,
imports the same as when it is said, that the sacraments are
signs or seals thereof, or significant ordinances for the directing
and exciting our faith, as conversant about what we are to
understand thereby. Again, <i>to exhibit</i>, sometimes signifies to
give, communicate, or convey; and because it is not only distinguished
from signifying and sealing in the definition which
we have of a sacrament in the Shorter Catechism; but is described
as that by which Christ and his benefits are applied
unto believers; therefore, I am inclined to think, that it is in
this latter sense that the word is to be taken in the answer
which we are explaining; and if so, we must distinguish between
Christ’s benefits being conveyed, made over, exhibited,
or applied, by the gift of divine grace, through the effectual
working of the Spirit; and this being done by an ordinance, as
an external means of grace; accordingly I am bound to conclude,
that as the Spirit of God gives these blessings to believers,
who engage in a right manner therein; so this grace
is represented, and God’s people have ground to expect, as far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>as an ordinance can be the means thereof, that they shall be
made partakers of these benefits.</p>

<p class='c006'>We may also observe, that, though the sacraments are appointed
to signify to all that partake of them, that Christ has
purchased salvation for his people; or, that the work of redemption
is brought to perfection: Yet it is they alone that
engage herein by faith, who can look upon them as signs or
seals to confirm their faith, that they have a right to the benefits
of Christ’s redemption, as not only signified, but exhibited
or applied to them: In this sense the sacraments are signs to
them that believe, in such a way as they are to no others.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. We are now to consider the persons to whom the sacraments
are given; and these are described as those who are
within the covenant of grace. To be within the covenant of
grace, implies in it, either a being externally in covenant with
God, or a being internally and spiritually so, as interested in
the saving blessings thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) They who are externally in covenant, are such as are
visibly so; who are called by his name, professedly devote
themselves to him, and lay claim to him as their God:
These, if they are no otherwise in covenant, are said to be in
Christ, as the branch which beareth no fruit, is said to be in
the vine, John xv. 2. like those whom the prophet speaks of,
when he says, <i>Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called
by the name of Israel, which swear by the name of the Lord,
and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth nor in
righteousness</i>, Isa. xlviii. 1. they have, indeed, the ordinances
which must be reckoned a very great privilege; they have the
external overtures of divine grace, the convictions and strivings
of the Spirit; and accordingly they are, in God’s way, in which
he is sometimes pleased to work special grace, which, when he
does, they may conclude themselves to have more than the
external blessings of the covenant, which is what we are next
to consider: Therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Others are internally or spiritually in covenant, children
of God by faith: These are such as are true and real members
of Jesus Christ, by a federal or conjugal union with him: They
have the same mind as was in him, and receive vital influences
from him, being made partakers of the Spirit. They have, not
only professedly, but by faith, embraced him in all his offices,
surrendered up themselves unto him, to be entirely his; their
understandings to be guided and directed, their wills and affections
to be governed by him, and are desirous to be disposed
of by him, in the whole conduct of their lives. And, as to the
privileges which they partake of, they have not merely a supposed,
but a real interest in all the benefits which Christ hath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>purchased, have a right to his special care and love, which will
render them safe and happy, both here and hereafter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, with respect to both these; they are, each of them,
supposed to attend on the sacraments: The former, indeed,
have not a right to the saving blessings signified thereby, and
therefore, if they know themselves to be strangers to the covenant
of promise, they profess, by engaging in this ordinance,
to lay claim to that which they have no right to: However, if
this be not discernible in their conversation, which is blameless
in the eye of the world, men, who are not judges of their hearts,
have no warrant to exclude them from the sacraments. But,
on the other hand, they who are savingly, or internally in covenant,
have not only a right to those ordinances in common with
others; but Christ and his benefits, as was before observed,
are exhibited and applied to them, as they have ground to conclude,
by faith, that they have an interest in all the blessings
which he has purchased.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. We are now to consider, what those benefits are that Christ
communicates to his people in the sacraments, which are signified
thereby: These are either,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Such as are common to the whole church, which are relative
and external, rather than internal, as hereby they are distinguished
from those that are without. These are advantages,
though not of a saving nature: Thus the apostle says,
<i>What advantage hath the Jew, or, what profit is there in circumcision</i>,
Rom. iii. 1, 2. To which he replies, <i>much every way</i>, or
in many respects, <i>q. d.</i> it is an honour which God has put on
the church, as taking them into a visible relation to himself,
and giving them the means of grace, in which they are more
favoured than the rest of the world: Or,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) There are those benefits of Christ’s mediation, which
are more especially applicable to believers; and, in this respect,
God makes every ordinance, and the sacraments in particular,
subservient to the increase of their faith, and all other graces.
As faith is wrought under the word, it is farther established
and increased by the Lord’s supper, as will be considered under
a following answer; and as they have herein an occasion to
exercise their mutual love to one another, so they have communion
with Christ, which has a tendency to carry on the work
of grace begun in the soul, and farther to enhance their love to
Christ, who is eminently set forth and signified herein; and,
from the view they have of their interest in him, arises a
stronger motive and inducement to hate all sin, that tends to
dishonour him, in the whole course of their lives. We are
now to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. How the sacraments become effectual means of salvation;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>or from whence their efficacy is derived, to answer that great
end.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Negatively. They do not become effectual means of salvation
by any power in themselves to answer this end; for we
are not to suppose, that they are more than ordinances, by
which God works those graces which we receive under them;
which it is his prerogative alone to confer. Again, it is farther
observed, that this privilege is not derived from the piety
or intention of them by whom the sacraments are administered;
who, though they are styled <i>stewards of the mysteries of
God</i>, 1 Cor. iv. 1. as persons to whom the administration thereof
is committed; yet they have not the least power to confer that
grace which is Christ’s gift and work: Thus the apostle says,
<i>Who then is Paul, or who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye
believed, even as the Lord gave unto every man</i>, chap. iii. 5.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>This is contrary to what the Papists maintain, who suppose
that the efficacy of the sacraments arises, partly from an internal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>virtue which there is in them, to confer grace, (which they
illustrate by a far-fetched similitude, taken from the virtue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>which there is in food, to nourish the body, which is nothing
to the purpose, since no external act of religion can have a tendency
to nourish the soul, without the internal efficacious grace
of the Spirit accompanying it;) and partly from the design or
intention of the priest that administers them, as they are consecrated
and designed, by him, for that end.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is also an absurd notion which is maintained by some
Protestants, as well as the Papists, <i>viz.</i> that the sacrament of
baptism, administered to infants, washes away the guilt of original
sin, and gives them a right and title to heaven, so that by
virtue thereof they are saved, if they happen to die before they
commit actual sin: But this account of the manner in which
the sacraments become effectual to salvation, is absurd to the
last degree; for it puts a sanctifying and saving virtue into
that which is no more than an outward and ordinary means of
grace. And as to what respects the efficacy of the sacraments,
arising from the intention of him that administers them; that
is, to lay the whole stress of our salvation on the secret design
of men, in whose power it is supposed to be, to render or prevent
these ordinances from being means of grace; which is in
the highest degree derogatory to the glory of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Positively. The sacraments become effectual means of
salvation only by the working of the Holy Ghost, and the
blessing of Christ, by whom they were instituted. As, <i>without
Christ we can do nothing</i>, John xv. 5. so without his blessing
we can receive nothing. Ordinances are only the channel
through which grace is conveyed; but Christ is the author and
finisher of faith; and this he does by his Spirit, when he brings
the heart into a good frame, and excites suitable acts of faith
and love in those who are engaged in those ordinances, and
maintains the lively impressions thereof, which have a tendency
to promote the work of grace in the whole conduct of
their lives.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We proceed to consider, what sacraments Christ has
instituted under the New Testament-dispensation. It hath
pleased God, in every age of the world, to instruct his people
by sacramental signs, as an addition to those other ways, in
which he communicates his mind and will to them. Even our
first parents, in their state of innocency, had the tree of life;
which was a sacrament or ordinance for their faith, that if they
retained their integrity, and performed the conditions of the
covenant which they were under, they might hereby be led into
a farther conviction that they should certainly attain the blessings
promised therein: And, some think, that the tree of knowledge,
of good and evil, was another sacramental sign, whereby
they were given to understand, that if they sinned, they should
die. And paradise, in which they were placed, was a sacrament,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>or a kind of type of the heavenly state; inasmuch as
there is an allusion to it in that promise, <i>to him that overcometh,
will I give to eat of the tree of life, that is in the midst of the paradise
of God</i>, Rev. ii. 7. and heaven is, in another place called
paradise, Luke xxiii. 43. Others think the Sabbath was a sacramental
sign to our first parents, of that eternal sabbatism
which they should celebrate in a better world, in case they
yielded perfect obedience as being the condition of the covenant
they were under. However, I desire not to be too peremptory
as to this matter; it is enough to my present purpose, to consider
the tree of life as a sacrament; whereby it appears, that
God instituted such signs from the beginning of the world:
But this having been insisted on elsewhere<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a>, we pass it over,
and proceed to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>That, after the fall of man, there were sacramental signs, instituted
as ordinances for the faith of the church in the promised
Messiah; especially sacrifices, which signified their expectation
that he would make atonement for sin, by the shedding
of his blood. Under the ceremonial law there was a large
body of sacramental ordinances, or institutions, otherwise called,
types of Christ, and the way of salvation by him; some of
which were occasional; as manna, the water of the rock, and
the brazen serpent in the wilderness, <i>&amp;c.</i> others were standing
ordinances in the church, as long as the ceremonial law continued;
as circumcision, the passover, and many things contained
in the temple-service. These were the sacraments under the
Old Testament: But, having taken occasion to speak something
concerning them elsewhere<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a>, I shall confine myself to
those sacraments which Christ has instituted under the New
Testament; which are only two, baptism, and the Lord’s
supper.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Papists, indeed, have added five more to them, though
without a divine warrant; to give countenance to which, they
pervert the sense of some scriptures, occasionally brought for
that purpose. One of the sacraments which they have added,
is, what they call <i>holy orders</i>; whereby they authorize persons
to perform the office of priests, or deacons: This they do
by the imposition of hands, and at the same time pretend to
confer the Holy Ghost: The former, they suppose to be the
sign, the latter the thing signified; but this was not designed
to be a sacrament given to the church; for the sacraments are
ordinances that belong to all believers, and not only ministers.
And, as for the imposition of hands, whether it be considered
as an ancient form of praying for a blessing on persons, or as
used in setting others apart to an office; it seems principally to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>have respect to these extraordinary gifts, which they expected
to qualify them for the discharge thereof; which gifts being
now ceased, the imposition of hands cannot be reckoned a sacramental
sign; and the blessing conferred, to wit, the Holy
Ghost, from whom they received those extraordinary gifts, is
no longer to be signified thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another sacrament which the Papists add, is that of <i>confirmation</i>;
by which they pretend, that children, who, in baptism,
were made members of Christ, are strengthened and confirmed
in the faith; and receive the Holy Ghost, in order to
their performing their baptismal vow: But, whatever engagement
they are laid under, by this ordinance, it is God alone
that can confirm or strengthen, and enable them to walk answerable
thereunto; which is a grace not in the power of man
to bestow, nor can it be by any ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another sacrament they speak of, is <i>pennance</i>; in which,
after auricular confession made to the priest, and some external
marks of sorrow expressed by the penitent, he is to perform
some difficult service enjoined, which they call pennance;
whereby he makes satisfaction for his sins, upon which, he
is absolved from them. But this is an abominable practice,
by which persons are rather hardened in sin, than delivered
from it. It is derogatory to Christ’s satisfaction, and has not
the least appearance of a sacrament, or ordinance of God’s
appointment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another sacrament that they have added, is <i>extreme unction</i>;
taken from James v. 14, 15. where the apostle speaks of
sick persons being <i>anointed with oil in the name of the Lord</i>;
and it is said, <i>the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the
Lord shall raise him up</i>; and, if he has committed <i>sins</i>, they
shall be <i>forgiven him</i>. But to this it may be replied, that
though this practice of anointing the sick with oil, was observed
in the first age of the church, while the miraculous
gift of healing was continued; yet it is now ceased; therefore
no such significant sign is to be used. And, as for forgiveness
of sins, mentioned by the apostle that seems not to
have been conferred by the use of that sign; but it was
humbly expected and hoped for, as an answer of prayer: It
is therefore a very preposterous thing to reckon this among
the sacraments, under the gospel dispensation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another Sacrament that the Papists add, is that of <i>matrimony</i>;
for which, they have very little shadow of reason;
but, because, they suppose, the apostle calls it <i>a great mystery</i>,
Eph. v. 32. which word, the Greek church used to signify
a sacrament: But he does not intend hereby, that marriage
is a mystery; but the union between Christ and his
church, which is illustrated by the conjugal union, is so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>called<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a>; and, indeed, it is not an ordinance given to the
church, but to mankind in general, heathens as well as Christians.
Therefore nothing can be more absurd than to suppose,
that it is one of the sacraments Christ hath instituted
in the gospel-church; and, according to their opinion, the
priests are excluded from this sacrament, inasmuch as they are
forbidden to marry, as the laity are excluded from the sacrament
of holy orders; so that when they pretend to add to those
institutions, which Christ hath given to the church, or invent
sacraments, which he hath not ordained, they betray not only
their own folly, but bold presumption; therefore we must
conclude, that there are only two sacraments that Christ hath
given to his church, to wit, baptism, and the Lord’s supper;
which are particularly considered in some following answers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXV.</span> <i>What is baptism?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Baptism is a sacrament of the New Testament, wherein
Christ hath ordained the washing with water, in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, to be
a sign and seal of ingrafting into himself, of remission of
sins by his blood, and regeneration by his Spirit; of adoption
and resurrection unto everlasting life; and whereby
the parties baptized are solemnly admitted into the visible
church, and enter into an open and professed engagement,
to be wholly and only the Lord’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>The method in which we shall endeavour to explain this
answer shall be,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. To prove that baptism is a sacrament of the New Testament,
instituted by Christ, in which there is to be, some way
or other, the application of water.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. That this is to be performed in the name of the Father,
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. What is signified therein, and what engagements are
laid upon the person baptized.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. To prove that baptism is a sacrament of the New Testament,
instituted by Christ, in which there is to be, some
way or other, the application of water. Here let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That there must be the application of water; and that
either by dipping the person that is to be baptized into the
water, or by pouring or sprinkling water upon him; otherwise
it doth not answer the proper and literal sense of the word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span><i>baptize</i>.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a> It is true, we sometimes find the word used in a
metaphorical sense; as when our Saviour speaks of the <i>baptism</i>
that he <i>was to be baptized with</i>, Matt. xx. 22. Luke xii.
50. whereby he intends the sufferings he was to endure in
shedding his blood upon the cross: And it is elsewhere taken,
by a metonymy, for the conferring the extraordinary gifts of
the Holy Ghost, which they were given to expect after Christ’s
ascension into heaven, and the apostles were first made partakers
of at the day of Pentecost, which immediately followed
it; wherein there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as
of fire, that sat upon each of them, as a sign that they should
be filled with the Holy Ghost, and speak with other tongues,
and be enflamed with a holy zeal for Christ’s glory and interest;
which was accordingly fulfilled, and seems to be the
sense of the word baptism, as taken in this figurative sense;
but we understand the word in the most proper sense thereof;
and therefore suppose that it must be performed with
water.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what respects the mode of baptism, or the application
of water, whether the water is to be applied to the person
baptized, or he put into it, that, I purposely wave the consideration
of, till we are led to speak concerning the subjects of
baptism, that we may insist on the several matters in controversy,
between those that maintain, and others that deny infant
baptism, together, which we shall have occasion to do under
the next answer: Whereas, I am ready to persuade myself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>that what I shall advance under this, together with that which
respects the improvement of baptism, will not be much contested
by those who are in a different way of thinking,
with respect to the subjects of baptism, and the mode of administering
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are now to consider, that baptism is a sacrament of
the New Testament; and therefore it differs from those baptisms,
or washings, that were frequently practised under the
Old Testament dispensation; concerning which, the apostle
says, that it <i>stood in meats and drinks, and divers washings</i>,
Heb. ix. 10. or <i>baptisms</i><a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a>. Thus we read of many instances
in which persons were washed under the ceremonial law:
This was an ordinance used in the consecration of persons to
holy offices; as it is said, that <i>Aaron and his sons</i> were to be
<i>brought to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and
washed with water</i>, Exod. xxix. 4. and Lev. viii. 6. when
they were consecrated to be priests. Again, when they ministered
in holy things, or came near unto the altar, it is said,
they <i>washed, as the Lord commanded Moses</i>, Exod. xl. 32. for
this reason the laver was set between the tent of the congregation
and the altar, and water put therein to wash in; and
they washed their hands and their feet therein, ver. 30, 31.
And this ceremony was used by them, when they were subject
to divers uncleannesses; thus, in the method of cleansing
the leper, he was to <i>wash himself</i>, and, <i>after that</i> might <i>come
into the camp</i>, Lev. xvi. 8, 9. The same thing was to be done
by those who were liable to uncleannesses of another nature,
Deut. xxii. 10, 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>These ceremonial washings, when applied to persons, seem
to be ordained to signify their consecration, or dedication, to
God, in some of the instances before mentioned; and in others,
they signified the means which God had ordained to cleanse
the soul from moral impurity; which was denoted by the ceremonial
uncleannesses which they desired to be purified from.
These ordinances, indeed, expired together with the rest of
the ceremonial law: Nevertheless, it is very evident, from the
institution of gospel-baptism, that the sign is retained; though
there are some circumstances in the thing signified thereby, in
which it differs from those baptisms which were formerly used
by the Jewish church. They were hereby devoted to God, to
observe that peculiar mode of worship which he prescribed
by the hand of his servant Moses; we are devoted to God,
as those who hereby signify our obligation to walk according
to the rules prescribed by Christ in the gospel. They also used
this ordinance, to signify the cleansing virtue of the blood of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Jesus, who was to come, and the Spirit that was to be poured
forth, as consequent thereupon; we use it to signify or express
our faith in what Christ has accomplished, and in the grace
which the Spirit works pursuant thereunto; therefore we call
it an ordinance of the New Testament.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Baptism was instituted by Christ. This is evident from
the commission he gave to his apostles, not only to preach the
gospel to all nations, but to <i>baptize them in the name of the
Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost</i>, Matt. xxviii. 19.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c012'><sup>[61]</sup></a>
and this he appointed to be a standing ordinance in the church,
throughout all the ages thereof; on which account he promises,
in the following words, that he will <i>be with</i> his ministers,
in fulfilling the commission that he gave them to execute, <i>unto
the end of the world</i>: Therefore, we must conclude, that it is
a standing ordinance in the church, and not designed to be observed
only during the first age thereof, till Christianity universally
obtained. This we assert in opposition to the Socinians,
who suppose, that baptism was, indeed, instituted by
Christ; but the design hereof, was only to be an external
badge, or sign, of the heathens embracing the Christian religion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>as they were formerly initiated into the Jewish church
by that ceremonial washing that was then in use: But the contrary
to this will appear from what we shall have occasion to
speak to, under a following head, when we consider what baptism
was a sign and seal of; which is equally applicable to
the church in our day, as it was to those who lived in the first
planting thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. It is farther observed, that baptism is to be performed
in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
This contains in it a professed acknowledgment, in this solemn
act of dedication of the divine Trinity; and accordingly it is
an act of religious worship, in which God’s right to the persons
baptized, is publicly owned, and an intimation given, that
all saving blessings, which are desired or expected in this ordinance,
are given by the Father, through a Mediator, purchased
by the Son, and applied by the Holy Spirit. This includes in
it much more than a being baptized by the authority of these
divine persons; which is all that some of the Antitrinitarians
will allow to be meant by, in their name: For though no ordinance
can be rightly performed but by a divine warrant, yet
this warrant is equally extended to the administering, or engaging
in any other ordinance; and therefore, a being baptized
in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, signifies
more than this; namely, a person’s being dedicated to them;
in which dedication, a solemn profession is made, that they
have a right to all religious worship, which we are obliged to
perform as well as that all our hope of salvation is from them:
Therefore, some think, that this idea, which is principally intended
in the form of baptism, would be better expressed, if
the words of institution<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a> were rendered <i>into the name</i> of the
Father, &amp;c. as it is rendered elsewhere, Gal. iii. 27. where the
apostle is speaking of a person’s being <i>baptized into Christ</i><a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a>,
and explains it as denoting a <i>putting on Christ</i>; or a professing,
as it is said, ver. 29. that <i>we are Christ’s</i>. Thus they who
are baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
are denoted hereby, to be professedly their servants and subjects;
under an indispensible obligation to put their trust in,
and hope for, all saving blessings from them, according to the
tenor of the gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is enquired, by some, whether it be absolutely necessary,
in the administration of this ordinance, explicitly to make mention
of the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost? and
some assert, that it is not; because we read of persons being
<i>baptized in the name of Jesus</i>, in Acts xix. 5. without any
mention of the name of the Father, or Holy Ghost; and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>chap. viii. 16. the same thing is mentioned, as it is said, <i>They
were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus</i>. But to this it
may be replied, that it does not appear, that this was the express
form of words used in baptizing those that are here mentioned;
but it only argues, that the ordinance was administered,
and that Christ’s name and glory was proclaimed therein:
So that, though the other divine persons are not particularly
mentioned, it does not follow from thence, that they did not
adhere to the express words of institution, which were given
to the apostles; it might as well be argued, that John did not
baptize in the name of any of the Divine persons; since when
we read of his baptism, it is said, <i>I baptize you with water</i>;
but it does not thence follow, that he did not baptize them in
the name of God; inasmuch as he plainly confesses that <i>God
sent him to baptize with water</i>, John i. 33.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, that this matter may be set in a just light, we must
distinguish between a person’s omitting to mention the Son or
Holy Ghost, in the form of baptism, as denying them to be
divine persons, (in which case the ordinance is invalid;) and
his doing this for no other reason, but because he thinks that
we are not to be tied up to a particular form of words, but may
sometimes baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost; and, at other times, in the name of Jesus: In this case,
I will not say that the ordinance is invalid; but yet, his manner
of administering it, will be highly offensive to many serious
Christians, and can hardly be reckoned an instance of faithfulness
to Christ; who has, by an express command, intimated what
words are to be used therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We are now to consider, what is signified in baptism,
and what engagements are laid on the person baptized. There
are some, especially among the Socinians, who maintain, that
it is only an external, or visible badge of Christianity in general,
signifying a person’s right to be called a Christian, or a
professor of that religion, which was instituted by our Saviour;
and their design herein seems to be, that they might evade the
force of the argument which we bring to prove the divinity of
the Son and Spirit, from their being the object of that religious
worship, which according to our explication thereof, is contained
in it. Did they intend, by being a Christian, the same
thing as we do, namely, a subjection to Christ, as a divine person,
or a professed obligation which we are laid under, to worship
God the Father, through the Son, by the Spirit, we should
have no contention with them about this matter: But since
we are not agreed as to the meaning of being a Christian, especially,
since they intend no more hereby than our being
obliged to adhere to a certain scheme of religious worship prescribed
by Christ, of what kind soever it be, in like manner as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>a person is called a Mahometan, because he embraces Mahomet’s
Alcoran as a rule of faith, we cannot think this general
account of baptism, as an external badge of Christianity, to
be a sufficient explication of what is intended by it as a sign,
or significant ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are several things mentioned in this answer, of which,
it is said, to be a sign and seal, <i>viz.</i> of our engrafting into
Christ, and obtaining remission of sins by his blood, of our regeneration
by his Spirit, our adoption, and resurrection unto
eternal life, which include in them all the benefits of Christ’s
mediation; which have been particularly explained under
some foregoing answers: But there is one that contains in it
all the rest; and accordingly it is generally expressed, by divines,
as that which is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace,
and all the duties, obligations, and privileges that are either
enjoined or bestowed therein. What this covenant is, together
with the blessings thereof, and how the grace of God is
manifested therein, has been likewise considered under some
foregoing answers<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c012'><sup>[65]</sup></a>. Therefore all that I shall now add concerning
it, is, that it contains all the promises in which our salvation
is included, of which there is one that comprehends all
the rest, whereby it is often expressed, namely, that God will be
a God unto his people, Gen. xiv. 1. <i>their shield, and exceeding
great reward</i>, chap. xvii. And elsewhere that he will <i>put his
laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts, and will
be to them a God; and they shall be to him a people</i>, Heb. viii.
10. There are very great privileges contained in this relation,
namely, our being under the special care and protection of
Christ, having a right to what he has purchased, and that inheritance
which he has laid up in heaven for his children, their
enjoying communion with him here, and being made happy
with him hereafter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the main thing to be considered, is, how baptism is a
sign and seal thereof? To this it may be answered, that we
are not to suppose that this, or any other ordinance, confers
the grace of the covenant, as the Papists pretend<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a>; for it is,
at most, but a significant sign or seal thereof; whereas, the
grace of the covenant is the thing signified thereby. There
are, as has been before observed two ways, by which persons
may be said to be in covenant with God, namely, professedly,
or visibly, which is the immediate intent and design of this
ordinance; and there is a being in covenant, as laying hold on
the grace of the covenant, when we give up ourselves to
Christ, by faith; and, as the consequence thereof, lay claim to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>the blessings of his redemption. Now baptism is a sign and
seal of the covenant of grace in both these senses, though in
different respects. The ordinance itself is a professed dedication
to God, or an acknowledgment that the person baptized
is obliged to be the Lord’s; and signifies his right to the external
blessings of the covenant of grace, which are contained
in the gospel-dispensation. There is also more than this contained
in a person’s being given to God in baptism, whether it
be by himself as in those who are baptized when adult; or by
his parents, as in the case of infants, in that the person who
dedicates, expresses his faith in Christ, the Mediator of the
covenant, and hopes for the saving blessings which he has
purchased for his people. It is one thing, for this ordinance
to confer these blessings, and another, for it to be an instituted
means, in which we express our faith and hope, that these
blessings shall be bestowed, the person being devoted to God
with that view.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are other two things that are more especially signified
in baptism, namely, privileges expected, and obligations acknowledged.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The privileges expected are such as accompany salvation,
which are the special gift of the Holy Ghost, <i>viz.</i> the taking
away the guilt and pollution of sin, and our being made partakers
of all the blessings that Christ hath purchased, and God
the Father, in him, has promised to the heirs of salvation. I
do not say, that all who are baptized are made partakers of
these privileges; but they are given up to God, or give up
themselves to him in this ordinance, in hope of obtaining them.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Here is a public profession, or acknowledgment of our
obligation to be the Lord’s. This is, from the nature of the
thing, implied in its being a dedication to God. When we
make a surrender of ourselves to him, we do hereby declare,
that we are willing to be his servants and subjects, and entirely
at his disposal: This is contained in a fiducial act of self-dedication
to God, and cannot be done by one in the behalf of
another: And, it is to be feared, that many, who give up
themselves to God in this ordinance, when adult, though they
make a profession of their faith, yet do not give up themselves
by faith; but that is only known to the heart-searching God:
Nevertheless, as we express our faith and hope, in this ordinance,
concerning the privileges but now mentioned; so we,
in this act of dedication, confess, that God has a right to us,
and that it is our indispensible duty to be his, so that hereby
we are, either by our own consent, as in self-dedication, professedly
the Lord’s; or this is acknowledged by those who
have a right to dedicate, and thereby to signify this obligation;
which, because it is highly just and reasonable, the persons devoted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>are obliged to stand to, or else are brought under a great
degree of guilt, in not being stedfast in God’s covenant.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is one thing more mentioned in this answer, namely,
that the person baptized, is solemnly admitted into the visible
church, which I rather choose to pass over; since it is hard to
understand what some mean by the visible church, and a person’s
becoming a member thereof by baptism. We have elsewhere
considered the difficulties that are contained in the
description of the visible church; together with the qualifications
for, and admission of persons into church-communion.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a>
If, by being admitted into the visible church, we are to understand
that a person has a right to all the ordinances of the
church by baptism, without being admitted afterwards into it
by mutual consent; this is contrary to the faith and practice of
most of the reformed churches. And if, on the other hand,
they mean hereby, that here is a public declaration of our
hope, that the person baptized shall be made partaker of those
privileges which Christ has purchased for, and given to his
church: This is no more than what has been already explained
in our considering the baptismal expectations and obligations;
but, whether this can be properly called an admission into the
church, I rather leave to be determined by those who better
understand what they mean, when they say that this is done in
baptism, than I do.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXVI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXVI.</span> <i>Unto whom is baptism to be administered?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><i>Answ.</i> Baptism is not to be administered to any that are out
of the visible church, and so strangers from the covenant of
promise, till they profess their faith in Christ, and obedience
to him; but infants descending from parents, either
both, or but one of them, professing faith in Christ, and obedience
to him, are in that respect within the covenant, and to
be baptised.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this answer, which principally respects the subjects of
baptism, we have,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. An account of those who are excluded from this privilege,
<i>viz.</i> such as are out of the visible church, and so strangers
from the covenant of promise. The visible church is
here considered in the most large and less proper acceptation
of the word, as denoting all who profess the true religion; and
in this respect is opposed to the Jews and heathen, and those
who, though they live in a Christian nation, are grossly ignorant
of the gospel, and act as though they thought that it did
not belong to them, not seeing themselves obliged to make any
profession thereof: These may be ranked among infidels, as
much as the heathen themselves; and, according to this sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>of the word, are not members of the visible church; and, consequently,
while they remain so, are not to be admitted to
baptism. This is agreeable to the sentiments and practice of
most of the reformed churches; and it cannot but be reckoned
highly reasonable, by all who consider baptism as an ordinance
in which a public profession is made of the person’s being
devoted to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and,
if he be considered as adult (and of such we are now speaking)
there is a signification, and thereby a profession made, that he
gives up himself to God; and, if the ordinance be rightly applied,
there must be an harmony between the inward design of
the person dedicating, and the true intent and meaning of the
external sign thereof; which, by divine appointment, is a visible
declaration of his adhering by faith, to the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, and embracing that salvation which
takes its rise from them. This therefore must be done by
faith; or else the ordinance is engaged in after an hypocritical
manner; which will tend to God’s dishonour, and the prejudice
rather than the advantage of him, to whom it is administered.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We are now to consider the necessity of their making a
profession of their faith in Christ, and obedience to him, who
being adult, are admitted to baptism. It was supposed, under
the last head, that if there be not an harmony between the internal
frame of spirit, in the person baptized, and the intent of
the external sign thereof, the ordinance is not rightly applied to
him, inasmuch as he pretends to dedicate himself to God; but,
in reality does not do this by faith: And now it may be farther
considered, that it is necessary that he should make it appear,
that he is a believer, by a profession of his faith; otherwise,
he that administers the ordinance, together with the assembly,
who are present at the same time, cannot conclude that they
are performing a service that is acceptable to God; therefore,
for their sakes, as well as his own, the person to be baptized,
ought to make a profession of his subjection to Christ, as what
is signified in this ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is agreeable to the words of institution, in Matt. xxviii.
19. <i>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them</i>, &amp;c.
and in Mark xvi. 15. <i>Go ye into all the world, and preach the
gospel to every creature; he that believeth and is baptized, shall
be saved</i>, &amp;c. I am sensible that some, who have defended
infant-baptism, or rather attempted to answer objection
taken from this, and such like scriptures against it, have endeavoured
to prove the Greek word<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a> signifies, <i>make</i> persons
<i>disciples</i>; and accordingly it is a metaphor taken from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>practice of a person’s being put under the care of one who is
qualified to instruct him, whose disciple he is said to be, in order
to his being taught by him; and therefore they suppose,
that we are made disciples by baptism, and afterwards to be
<i>taught to observe all things whatsoever Christ hath commanded</i>;
and this is taken notice of in the marginal reading of our
Bibles; which supposes that the word may be rendered,
<i>make disciples of all nations</i>: But, I cannot think this sense of
the word so defensible, or agreeable to the design of our Saviour,
as that of our translation, <i>viz.</i> <i>Go teach all nations</i>;
which agrees with the words of the other evangelist, <i>Go preach
the gospel to every creature</i>: And besides, while we have recourse
to this sense to defend infant-baptism, we do not rightly
consider that this cannot be well applied to adult-baptism,
which the apostles were first to practise; for it cannot be said
concerning the heathen, that they are first to be taken under
Christ’s care by baptism, and then instructed in the doctrines
of the gospel, by his ministers<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a>.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, a profession of faith in those who are baptized
when adult, is agreeable to the practice of the Christian church
in the first planting thereof: Thus it is said, in Acts ii. 41.
<i>They that gladly received the word were baptized</i>: And this
might also be observed in the account we have of the jailor
and the Eunuch’s being first converted, and then baptized, in
Acts xvi. 31-33. chap. viii. 37, 38. But, if it be retorted
upon us, as though we were giving up the cause of infant-baptism,
it must be observed, that this does not, in the least, affect
it; for when our Saviour gave forth his commission to the
apostles, to teach or preach the gospel to all nations, and baptize
them, it is to be supposed, that their ministry was to be
exercised among the adult, and that these then were utter
strangers to Christ and his gospel; therefore it would have
been a preposterous thing to put them upon devoting themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>to him, before they were persuaded to believe in him:
neither could they devote their children till they had first dedicated
themselves to him, and this leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The right of infants to baptism, provided they, who are
required to dedicate them to God therein, are believers; and
particularly, that such may be baptized who descend from parents
of whom only one is a believer. This will appear,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. If we consider baptism as an ordinance of dedication:
Accordingly, let it be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That it is the indispensible duty of believers, to devote
themselves and all they have, to God, which is founded in the
law of nature, and is the result of God’s right to us and ours.
Whatever we have received from him, is to be surrendered or
given up to him; whereby we own him to be the proprietor of
all things, and our dependence upon him for them, and that
they are to be improved to his glory. This is, in a particular
manner, to be applied to our infant-seed, whom it is our duty
to devote to the Lord, as we receive them from him: However,
there is this difference between the dedication of persons,
from that of things, to God, that we are to devote them to
him, in hope of their obtaining the blessings which they are
capable of, at present, or shall stand in need of from him,
hereafter. This, I think, is allowed, by all Christians. Nothing
is more common, than for some who cannot see that it is their
duty to baptize their children, to dedicate or devote them to
God, by faith and prayer; which they do in a very solemn
manner; and that with expectation of spiritual blessings, as an
encouragement of their faith, so far as they apprehend them
capable of receiving them.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We shall now consider, that baptism, in the general
idea thereof, is an ordinance of dedication or consecration of
persons to God. If this be not allowed of, I cannot see how
it can be performed by faith, in the name of the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost; or how this can be a visible putting on of
Christ, as the apostle styles it, Gal. iii. 27.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> This proposition would not be denied, if baptism
were to be considered as an ordinance of self-dedication,
but then it would effectually overthrow the doctrine of infant-baptism;
for since infants cannot devote themselves to
God in this ordinance, therefore it is not to be applied to
them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that as there is no other
medium, which, I apprehend, can be made use of to prove
that the solemn acts of consecration or dedication to God in
baptism, is to be made only by ourselves, but what is taken
from a supposition of the matter in controversy, by those who
assert that infants are not to be baptized: So if this method
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>of reasoning be allowed of, we might as well say, on the other
hand; infants are to be baptized; therefore baptism is not an
ordinance of self-dedication, since they cannot devote themselves
to God; and that would militate against what, I think,
is allowed of by all, that baptism, when applied to the adult,
is an ordinance of self-dedication. That which I would therefore
more directly assert, in answer to this objection is, that
baptism is an ordinance of dedication, either of ourselves, or
others; provided the person who dedicates, has a right to that
which he devotes to God, and can do it by faith. When I do,
as it were, pass over my right to another, there is nothing required
in order hereunto, but that I can lawfully do it, considering
it as my property; and this is no less to be doubted concerning
the infant-seed of believers than I can question, whether
an adult person has a right to himself, when he gives up
himself to God in this ordinance.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c012'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) It follows, from the last head, that parents, who have a
right to their infant-seed, may devote them to God in baptism,
provided they can do it by faith; and therefore a profession
of faith, is only necessary in those who are active, in this ordinance,
not in them that are merely passive. This we are
obliged to maintain against those who often intimate that children
are not to be baptized, because they are not capable of
believing: Or when it is replied hereunto, that they are capable
of having the seeds of faith, though not the acts thereof;
this is generally reckoned insufficient to support our argument,
by those who are on the other side of the question; inasmuch
as it cannot well be determined, what infants have the seeds of
faith, and what not; and, I think those arguments which are
generally brought to prove that the infants of believing parents,
as such, have the seeds of faith, on the account whereof
they are to be baptized can hardly be defended; because
many good men have wicked children.</p>

<p class='c006'>Therefore what we insist on in this argument, is, that believing
parents may give up their children to God in baptism,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>in hope of their obtaining the blessings of the covenant,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a>
whether they are able to conclude that they have the seeds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>grace or no; they may devote them to God in hope of regeneration;
though they cannot know them to be regenerate, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>all ordinances are to be performed with this view, that they
may be rendered effectual means of grace. And from hence it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>may be inferred, as is observed in this answer, that infants descending
from parents, either both, or but one of them, professing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>faith in Christ, are to be baptized; since one parent has as
much a right to the child as the other: Therefore, the unbelief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>of one does not exclude the other from giving it up to
God by faith, in hope of its obtaining the saving blessings of the
covenant of grace. 1 Cor. vii. 14.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The right of the infant-seed of believers to baptism, may
be farther proved, from their being capable of the privileges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>signified therein; and under an indispensable obligation to perform
the duties which they, who dedicate them to God, make
a public profession of, as agreeable to the design of this ordinance.
None are to be excluded from any of those ordinances,
which Christ has given to the church, but they who are either
in a natural or a moral sense, to be deemed incapable subjects
thereof. Some, indeed, are incapable of engaging in ordinances,
by reason of a natural unmeetness for them, as infants are not
to be admitted to the Lord’s supper, as being under a natural
incapacity; and, ignorant and profane persons are not to be admitted
to it, as being under a moral incapacity; and, for the
same reason, a wicked man, when adult, is not a proper subject
of baptism: But if there be neither of these bars to exclude
persons, they are not to be denied the advantage of any ordinance.
This, I think will be allowed by all; and therefore,
the only thing I need prove is, that infants are not incapable of
the principal things signified in baptism. That they are not incapable
of being dedicated to God, has been proved under the last
head; and now we shall consider several privileges that are signified
therein, which they are equally capable of; as,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Baptism is an external sign of that faith and hope
which he has, that dedicates a person to God, that the person
dedicated, shall obtain the saving blessings of the covenant
of grace; Now, that infants are capable of these blessings,
none will deny, who suppose them capable of salvation.
If we suppose infants not to have regenerating grace, which
is neither to be affirmed or denied, it being a matter, at present,
unknown to us; yet they are capable of having it, for
the reason but now assigned; and though they cannot at
present, put forth any acts of grace, they will be capable
thereof, as soon as they are able to discern between good
and evil.</p>

<p class='c006'>They are not excluded by their infant-state, from being
under Christ’s special care; which is, doubtless, to be
extended to elect infants as well as others; and they are capable
of being discharged from the guilt of original sin, though
not of laying claim to this privilege, which they may be enabled
to do afterwards. Now, if infants are capable of these privileges,
certainly the person who dedicates them to God, (who
has a right to do it, inasmuch as they are his property, and he
is able to do it by faith) may devote them to him, with the exercise
of this grace, and a fiducial expectation that they shall
obtain these privileges: And, indeed, when we engage in this
ordinance, we ought to expect some saving blessings, as the
consequence hereof, as much as when we engage in any other
ordinance of divine appointment.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> It is objected to this, that though a person may devote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>his child to God in hope of his obtaining saving blessings;
yet he cannot exercise any act of faith, that he shall obtain
them: Therefore though he may perform this duty with a degree
of hope, or, at least, with a desire hereof; yet he
cannot do it by faith: Therefore, if children are to be devoted
to God by faith, they are not the subjects of this ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that some things may be
said to be done by faith, when we have not a certain ground
to expect the saving fruits and effects thereof. Suppose an infant
was expiring and the tender parent concerned about its
salvation, whether he has a certain expectation that it shall be
saved or no; yet he may, and ought to be earnest with God
by faith and prayer, that the child may be happy when taken
out of the world; and, if he finds that he has the lively exercise
of faith, with respect to this matter, this will afford him
some degree of hope, that God, who excited this grace in him,
will own it by giving the blessings which he desires; which
is the only comfort that a parent can take in the loss of his infant-seed:
And, may there not be this act of faith, when he
dedicates him to God in baptism? Did we assert that giving
up our children to God by faith, necessarily infers their obtaining
saving blessings, the objection would have some force
in it; or if there could be no faith exercised, without our being
certainly persuaded that this should have a saving effect;
then it might be argued, that because we are not certain that
infants shall be saved, therefore we cannot give them up to
God by faith: But if there may be faith, where there is not
this certain persuasion, or any ground by which this matter
may be determined, then, I think, it will follow, that infants
may be devoted to God by faith, as well as with a desire of
their obtaining saving blessings, and, consequently, this objection
does not take away the force of our argument. We are
far from supposing that baptismal dedication necessarily infers
these saving blessings, or is inseparably connected with
them, so that the one cannot be without the other. Therefore,
it is sufficient to our purpose, to suppose that they are capable
of those blessings which faith desires, and, it may be,
hopes for; and, consequently, of those things which are principally
signified in baptism.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Infants are under an indispensable obligation to perform
the duties which are incumbent on those who are given up to
God in baptism, and signified thereby. This respects some
things future, (they being, at present, incapable of performing
any duty) and, indeed, obligations to perform duties may respect
the time to come, as well as the time present; as when a
person is bound to pay a just debt, this obligation is valid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>though it is not expected that it should be immediately paid.
Thus infants are professedly bound, when given up to God, to
be the Lord’s: Whether ever they will give up themselves to
him by faith, or no, is unknown to us, nevertheless, the obligation
will take place as soon as they are capable of doing
good or evil. Therefore it follows, that the parent may bind
his child to be the Lord’s, inasmuch as the obligation is just,
as being founded in God’s right to obedience, and when he
has laid his child under it in this ordinance, he ought afterwards
strictly to charge him to stand to it, as he would not
contract double guilt; not only in neglecting to perform an indispensable
duty, but to pay that debt of obedience which has
been so solemnly acknowledged in this ordinance. These arguments
taken from the nature and design of the ordinance of
baptism, give me the fullest conviction concerning our warrant
to apply it to infants: But there is one more which is not
wholly to be passed over, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>(3). It appears, that the infant-seed of believers, are to be
consecrated or devoted to God in baptism, because they are
included in the covenant wherein God has promised that he
will be a God to his people, and to their seed; who are, upon
this account, styled <i>holy</i> Ezra. ix. 2. And it is said concerning
Israel, that <i>they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and
their off-spring with them</i>, Isa. lxv. 23. the <i>branch</i> is said to
be <i>holy</i>, together with <i>the root</i>, Rom. xi. 16. and <i>the children
of the promise are counted for the seed</i>, chap. ix. 8. that is included
in that covenant in which God promised that he would
be a God to children, together with their parents, as he says
to Abraham; <i>I will establish my covenant between me and thee,
and to thy seed after thee, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed
after thee</i>, Gen. xvii. 7. And, in this sense, I think, we are to
understand the apostle’s words, in 1 Cor. vii. 14.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a> <i>The
unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife, and the
unbelieving wife by the believing husband; else were your children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>unclean, but now are they holy.</i> By these, and other expressions
of the like-nature, we are not to understand the special
saving grace of regeneration and sanctification; for that is
not a privilege that descends from parents to children by birth,
as our Saviour says, <i>We are born not of blood, nor of the will
of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God</i>, John i. 13.
Therefore, when some, who are on the other side of the question,
think that we intend hereby the saving blessings of the
covenant, or that holiness which is an internal qualification or
meetness for heaven, they do not rightly understand our meaning.
Some, indeed, may have given occasion to conclude that
they intend this, who speak of the grace of regeneration as
conferred in baptism; and assert, that it intitles persons to
salvation, if they happen to die before they are adult: Whereas,
if afterward they appear to be in an unconverted state, by
the wickedness of their conversation, they are said to fall from
that grace. This is what I do not well understand; nor do I
intend, when I speak of the infants of believers as an holy seed,
that they are all internally regenerate or sanctified from the
womb; but they are included in the external dispensation of
the covenant of grace; which must be reckoned a greater advantage
than if they had descended from Indians, who are
strangers to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am sensible, indeed, that they who deny infant-baptism,
suppose that the holiness of the children spoken of by the apostle
in the scripture but now referred to, who descended
from parents, of whom one only was a believer, implies nothing
else but their being legitimate: But that does not seem
to be his meaning; inasmuch as marriage is an ordinance of
the law of nature, which all, without distinction, have a right
to, heathens as much as Christians; and the children of the
one, are as legitimate as those of the other. Therefore, there is
something else intended by their being holy, namely, the same
thing that is meant in those other scriptures that we but now
referred to, as taken for an external relative holiness, whereby
God must be supposed to have a greater regard to them than
to others who are styled unclean; and, if this does not infer,
as was before observed, their being internally regenerate or
sanctified: yet it is not a word without an idea affixed to it:
Therefore we must understand thereby, an holiness in the lowest
sense of the word; as children, are said to be <i>an heritage
of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb his reward</i>, Psal. cxxxvii.
7. or, it denotes the obligation they are laid under, by the
privilege of their descending from believing parents, to adhere
to their fathers’ God; which obligation is professed or acknowledged,
when they are dedicated to him in baptism, as has
been before observed; and this is the use which I would make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of this account which we have of them in scripture, to prove
their right to be devoted to God in this ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, I think, we do not assert this without some warrant
from scripture; for when God told Abraham, in the promise
but now mentioned, that he would be <i>a God unto him, and to
his seed</i>, which is the foundation of their federal holiness; this
is assigned as a reason why they should be devoted to God
in circumcision, Gen. xvii. 10. for we cannot but conclude
circumcision, as we do baptism, to have been an ordinance of
dedication or separation to God: And, in Acts ii. 39. when
the apostle had been pressing those Jews, amongst the mixed
multitude, to whom he had preached, to <i>repent and be baptized</i>;
and encouraged them to hope for the <i>gift of the Holy
Ghost</i>; he assigns this as a reason, namely, that <i>the promise
was to them and to their children</i>, which refers to the promise
of the covenant made with Abraham, and his seed; and it immediately
follows, <i>and to them that are afar off</i>, that is, the Gentiles,
who might claim this promise, when they believed, whom
the apostle calls elsewhere, <i>children of the promise, as Isaac
was</i>, Gal. iv. 28. These who are styled, before conversion, a
people <i>afar off</i>, were after it reckoned the spiritual seed of
Abraham, and so had a right to the blessings of the covenant,
that God would be a God to them; and, by a parity of reason,
in the same sense in which the seed of Abraham were children
of the promise, the seed of all other believers are to be
reckoned so, till by their own act and deed, they renounce this
external covenant relation: Now, from hence it may be inferred,
that if they stand in this relation, to God, this is publicly
to be owned; and accordingly they are to be given up to
him in baptism, as there is therein a professed declaration
thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what was but now inferred from the infant-seed of believers
under the Old Testament having a right to circumcision,
because they were included in the covenant which God
made with their fathers, that therefore they have a right to
baptism; this is not to be wholly passed over; though, I am
sensible, they who deny infant-baptism, will not allow of the
consequence. Some have argued, in opposition to it, that circumcision
was ordained to be a sign and seal of that covenant
of peculiarity, which God made with the Jewish church, or of
those blessings which they were made partakers of, as a
nation excelling others, in name, honour, and glory: But this,
I think, comes far short of what the apostle says on that
subject, <i>viz</i>. that it was <i>a seal of the righteousness of faith</i>,
Rom. iv. 11. And, indeed, when we call that dispensation a
covenant of peculiarity, we intend nothing else thereby, but
some external privileges annexed to the saving blessings of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>covenant of grace; and therefore, Abraham’s faith was conversant
on both of them; the righteousness of faith, which respected
his own salvation, and that of his spiritual seed; and
those privileges of a lower nature, which they who were, in
other respects, his seed, were made partakers of, by virtue of
the covenant, in which God promised that he would be a God
to him, and to his seed. Moreover, it is generally denied, by
those who are on the other side of the question, that baptism
comes in the room of circumcision. This therefore remains to
be proved, in order to our establishing the consequence, that
since children were to be devoted unto God by circumcision
under the law, they are to be devoted unto him by baptism,
under the gospel-dispensation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, that this may appear, let it be considered, that God
has substituted some ordinances, under the gospel-dispensation,
in the room of others, which were formerly observed under the
ceremonial law. Thus the Lord’s supper is instituted in the
room of the passover; otherwise the apostle would never have
alluded to one when he speaks of the other, and says, <i>Christ,
our passover, is sacrificed for us; therefore let us keep the
feast</i>, &amp;c. 1 Cor. v. 7, 8. And we have as much ground to
conclude, that baptism comes in the room of circumcision, as
we have that any gospel-ordinance comes in the room of another,
that belonged to the ceremonial law, from what the apostle
says, <i>in whom ye are circumcised by the circumcision made
without hands, buried with him in baptism</i>, Col. ii. 11, 12.
where he speaks of the thing signified by circumcision and
baptism, as being the same, namely, our communion with
Christ in his death; so that the thing signified by baptism, is
styled, as it were, a spiritual circumcision: Therefore, since
these two ordinances, signify the same thing for substance, and
are set one against the other in this scripture, we may, I think,
infer from thence, that baptism comes in the room of circumcision.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, it is farther argued, that baptism being the only initiating
ordinance, at present, as circumcision was of old; so
that the first visible profession that was made, especially by
any significant ordinance, that they were the Lord’s, was made
therein, which is what we understand by an initiating ordinance
under the gospel, as circumcision was under the law, then
it follows, that it comes in the room thereof; or else no other
ordinance does: But if it be said, that no ordinance comes in
the room of circumcision, then the privileges of the church
under this present dispensation, would be, in a very disadvantageous
circumstance, less than they were under the former;
and if infants received any advantage by being devoted to
God by circumcision of old, but are not to be devoted to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>by baptism now, their condition is much worse than that of
those who were the children of such as lived under the legal
dispensation; whereas, on the other hand, God has not, under
this present dispensation, abridged the church of its privileges,
but rather increased them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 1. It is objected, that infants have no right to baptism,
because they cannot believe and repent, since these graces are
often mentioned in scripture, as a necessary qualification of
those who have a right to this ordinance, as might be sufficiently
proved from those scriptures in which persons are said
first to believe and repent, and then to be baptized; and, in
order thereunto, <i>the gospel</i> was first to be <i>preached</i>, according
to our Saviour’s direction, Mark xvi. 15, 16. And we read of
persons <i>gladly receiving</i> it, and <i>then</i> being <i>baptized</i>, Acts. ii.
41. therefore Philip would not baptize the Eunuch till he professed
his faith in Christ, chap. viii. 37, 38. Moreover, this is
called an ordinance of repentance, as none have a right to it,
but those who repent: Thus it is said, <i>John preached the baptism
of repentance for the remission of sins</i>, Mark i. 4. and elsewhere,
that he <i>baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying
to the people, that they should believe on him which should come
after him, that is, on Christ Jesus</i>, Acts. xix. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> We do not deny the necessity of faith and repentance
to baptism, in them who are adult, as appears by those
concessions which have been made under a foregoing head;
in which we considered, that none are to be baptized if adult,
till they profess faith in Christ and obedience to him; and this
ought to be accompanied with repentance, otherwise it is not
true and genuine; therefore we freely owned also, that the
gospel was to be preached by the apostles, to those who were
immediately concerned in their ministry, before they were
either to be baptized themselves, or their infant-seed. Nevertheless
this does not overthrow the doctrine of infant-baptism,
since that, as has been before proved, depends upon different
qualifications. Faith is, no doubt, necessary in the person
that dedicates, or devotes to God: But, if what has been
said concerning the obligation which every one that is able to
dedicate his child to God by faith, is under, to do it, (as much
as he that is able to dedicate himself to him by faith, when
adult, is bound to do it,) be true; then we are to have regard
only to the faith of him that dedicates, and to hope for the
saving privileges of faith and repentance, and all other graces,
as divine blessings to be bestowed on the person devoted to
God, as the great end which we have in view in this solemn
action.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span><i>Obj.</i> 2. There is another objection which is concluded, by
some, to be unanswerable, <i>viz.</i> that there is neither precept,
nor example in the New Testament, that gives the least countenance
to our baptizing infants; therefore it cannot be reckoned
a scripture doctrine, and consequently is not from
heaven, but of men.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that consequences justly deduced
from scripture, are equally binding with the words or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>examples contained therein. If this be not allowed of, we shall
hardly be able to prove many doctrines which we reckon not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>only to be true, but of great importance. It would be endless
to enter into a detail of particulars, to illustrate and confirm
this matter; and I cannot but think it unnecessary, since
they who deny infant-baptism, do not deny the validity of just
scripture-consequences.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Therefore, all that I need say to this is, that if the method
we have taken to prove infant-baptism, appears to be just; and
if the premises be true, the conclusion deduced from them,
must be allowed of; namely, that the infants of believing parents
are to be baptized, though this be not contained in so
many express words in scripture: And, I cannot but think
that the objection would equally hold good against Christ’s
dying for infants, as well as others, or of their being capable
of justification, regeneration, and the saving blessings of the
covenant of grace; and it might as well be inferred from
hence, that they are not to be devoted to God in other instances,
besides that of baptism; or that we have not the least
ground to expect their salvation; for it would be as hard a
matter to find this contained in express words of scripture, as
that which is the matter in controversy, to wit, that they are to
be baptized.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here I cannot but take notice of the method which the
learned Dr. Lightfoot takes to account for the silence of scripture,
as to this matter<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a>, which is, for substance, as follows,
<i>viz.</i> that baptism was well enough known to the Jews, as
practised by them under the ceremonial law; by which he
means the ordinance in general, as including in it a consecration
to God, to worship him in that way which he then instituted;
and accordingly they are said to have been <i>baptized into
Moses</i>. He also adds, that the apostle speaking concerning
this matter, as referring to what was done <i>in the cloud, and
the sea</i>, 1 Cor. x. 2. supposes that the whole congregation, of
which the infants which they had in their arms, were a part,
were solemnly devoted to God at that time; which, I cannot
but conclude to be more agreeable to the sense of the word
<i>baptize</i>, than that which some critics give, who suppose that
nothing is intended by it, but their being wet, or sprinkled
with the water of the sea, as they passed through it; for that
was only an occasional baptism, which could not be well
avoided. But, if I may be allowed a little to alter or improve
on his method of reasoning, I rather think, that the
apostle’s meaning is, that the whole congregation was <i>baptized
into Moses</i>, soon after they were delivered from the Egyptians,
while they were encamped at the sea-shore; at which time,
God, for their security, spread a cloud for a covering to them;
and then, as the kind hand of Providence had led the way,
and brought them under a renewed engagement, they hereupon
expressed their gratitude and obligation to be God’s people,
by this universal dedication to him in baptism. But to return
to the author but now mentioned; he adds, that when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Jacob was delivered from Laban, and set about the work of
reforming his household, he ordered them, not only to <i>put
away the strange gods that were among them</i>, but <i>to be clean</i>,
Gen. xxxv. 2. by which, as he observes, the Jews confess, that
baptism, or a dedication to God by washing, is intended. He
also observes, that the ordinance of baptism in general, before
Christ instituted gospel-baptism, was so well known by the
Jewish church, that they no sooner heard that John baptized,
but they came to his baptism; and they did not ask him, why
dost thou make use of this rite of baptizing? but, what is thy
warrant, or, <i>who sent thee to baptize</i>? He further adds, that
both John and Christ took up baptism as they found it in the
Jewish church; by which he means the ordinance in general,
without regard to some circumstances, in which Christ’s baptism
differed from that which was practised under the ceremonial
law; and this was, as he observes, applied by the Jewish
church to infants as well as grown persons; therefore, our Saviour
had no occasion, (when he instituted this ordinance with
those circumstances, agreeable to the gospel-state, in which it
differs from the baptism which was before practised,) to command
them to baptize all nations, that is, all who were the subjects
of baptism, and infants in particular.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 3. It is further objected, that our Saviour was not baptized
in his infancy; therefore his example is to be followed,
and, consequently, no one is to be baptized till he be adult.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that every circumstance
or action in the life of Christ, is not designed to be an example
to us; and, indeed, there were some things signified in
his baptism, that are not in ours, inasmuch as in its application
to him, it did not signify his being cleansed from the guilt and
power of sin. The only thing wherein that which was signified
in his baptism, agrees with ours, is in that he devoted
himself unto God, not as expecting salvation through a Mediator
as we do, but as denoting his consent to engage in the
work that he came into the world about; which he now began
to perform in a public manner, which he fulfilled in the
course of his ministry, while he went about doing good. Now
it was not convenient that this should be done in his infancy;
for though the work of redemption began from that time; yet
his proving himself to be the Messiah, especially his doing this
in a public manner, did not take place till he was thirty years
of age, and then he was baptized, that this might be an ordinance
for the faith of his church, that he was engaged in the
work of our redemption. Moreover, it must be considered,
that John’s baptism, which circumstantially differed from that
which was practised in the Jewish church, as well as our Saviour’s,
was not instituted till the year before Christ was baptized;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>therefore he could not be baptized agreeably to the alteration
that was made in baptism at this time, had he been
baptized in his infancy.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 4. It is further objected, that infant baptism is a novelty,
and not practised by the church in the earliest ages
thereof from the apostles’ time.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that if this could be proved
to be true, I should regard arguments deduced from scripture-consequences,
much more than the sense of antiquity to determine
this matter. The principal use of the writings of the
Fathers, in my opinion, is to lead us into the knowledge of
what relates to the historical account of the affairs of the church
in their respective ages. The main thing supposed in this objection
is, that infant-baptism was not practised in the early
ages of the church; the contrary to which will appear, if we
consider some things mentioned by the Fathers concerning this
matter: Thus Justin Martyr says, we have not received the
carnal but circumcision by spiritual baptism; and all persons
are, in like manner, enjoined to receive it, as they were to
receive circumcision of old, wherein he refers to that of
the apostle, in Coloss. ii. 11, 12. <i>We are circumcised with
the circumcision made without hands, buried with him in
baptism</i>; and, consequently, he supposes that baptism comes
in the room of circumcision, as has been observed elsewhere;
and he likewise speaks of their being brought to
the water, and there regenerated; by which he means, baptized,
in the same manner as we are, in the name of
the Father, our Lord and Saviour, and the Holy Ghost<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a>.
And Cyprian, in a council, wherein there were sixty-six bishops
convened, delivered it not only as his opinion, but supposes
it to have been received by them all, that infants ought
to be baptized before the eighth day, in answer to a question
under debate, whether the time in which this ordinance was to
be performed ought to be the same with that in which children
were circumcised under the law<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a>. And, Irenæus<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a>,
speaks of Christ’s sanctifying and saving persons of every
age, infants not excepted; and therefore they are to be regenerated;
by which he means, baptized; as the Fathers often
put the thing signified for the sign: And Gregory Nazianzen
speaks to the same purpose<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a>, that baptism may be performed
as circumcision was, on the eighth day; but that it ought not
to be omitted any longer, than till the children are two, or
three years old. And to this I might add, the testimony of
Augustin; who asserts, that it had been practised by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>church, in foregoing ages, from our Saviour’s time; which,
had it not been matter of fact, he would, doubtless, have been
disproved by Pelagius, and his other antagonists<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is further objected, by those who deny infant-baptism,
that the practice of many in the ancient church, who deferred
baptism till they were adult, argues, that they did not think it
lawful for any to be baptized in infancy. Thus Constantine
the great, as Eusebius observes, was not baptized till a little
before his death: And, it is well known, that Gregory Nazianzen,
and Chrysostom, Ambrose, Augustin, and others of
the Fathers, were not baptized till they came to a state of manhood;
and Tertullian, who lived in the second century, exhorts
persons to defer baptism, and adds, that it is the safest
way to delay the baptism of infants, till they are capable
of engaging for themselves, being arrived to years of discretion<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a>.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>But to this it may be answered, that particular instances, or
the sentiments of some of the Fathers are not sufficient to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>prove that infant-baptism was not practised by the ancient
church. As to what is alleged concerning Constantine’s not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>being baptized till a little before his death, and Gregory Nazianzen,
Chrysostom, <i>&amp;c.</i> not till they were adult: This may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>be accounted for, by supposing that their parents did not embrace
the Christian religion while they were infants: and, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>that were true, they ought not to be baptized till they could
give up themselves to God by faith: This a late learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>writer attempts to prove<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c012'><sup>[86]</sup></a>. Moreover, some who have been
converted, have neglected baptism, out of a scruple they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>had of their unfitness for it, as many, in our day, do the
Lord’s supper; and others, it may he, might have neglected to
baptize their infants, or to be baptized themselves, till they
apprehended themselves near to death, as being misled by a
false supposition, which was imbibed by several, that baptism
washed away sin; therefore, the nearer they were to their end,
the more prepared they would be, by this ordinance, for a better
world. However, whether it was neglected for this, or
any other reason, it does not much affect the argument we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>maintaining, our design being principally to prove, that it was
practised in the early ages of the church; and, in what instances
soever it was omitted, it was not because they denied
that the infants of believing parents had a right to it. As to
several things mentioned by the authors before cited, and
others that treat on that subject, whereby they seem to maintain
the absolute necessity thereof, to wash away the pollution
of sin; or, when they assert, that it is as necessary to salvation
as regenerating grace, we have nothing to say as to this method
of reasoning: However, whatever they speak in defence
of it, is a sufficient evidence that it is not a practice of late invention.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what respects Tertullian’s advice to defer baptism till
persons were capable to engage for themselves; this caution
argues, that it was practised by some, which is the principal
thing designed to be proved. And the reason assigned by
him for the neglect of baptism, being this, because the sureties,
who undertook to instruct them in the doctrines of religion,
often promised more than they made conscience of performing,
and so brought themselves into a snare thereby; therefore,
for their sakes, infant-baptism, which could not be administered
without sureties, had better be delayed; this only
proves that he was against infant-baptism for some prudential
reasons, as it was attended with this inconvenience, not that he
thought it was in itself unlawful to be practised by them.
From hence we may conclude, that the objection taken from
infant-baptism, being supposed to be a novelty, does not
weaken the cause we are maintaining<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c012'><sup>[87]</sup></a>. Thus concerning the
subjects of baptism.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are now to consider the mode thereof, or what we are
to understand by the word baptism. It is said, in the foregoing
answer, to be the washing with water, in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. There has
been a great dispute in the world, concerning the meaning of
the word βαπτιζω, by which this ordinance is expressed; from
whence arises the different mode of the administration thereof.
Some think, that it only signifies the putting a person, or thing,
into the water, whereby it is covered, or, as it were, buried in
it; which is otherwise expressed by the word dipping. Others
(whose opinion I cannot but acquiesce in) conclude that it may
as well be performed by the application of water, though it be
in a different manner, either by pouring or sprinkling; and accordingly,
that it signifies the using the means of cleansing by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>the application of water, whatever be the form or mode thereof.
This argument depends very much upon the sense in which
the word is applied to the action intended thereby, either in
scripture or other writers. And, inasmuch as the sense
thereof, as used in scripture, and other writings, is well explained
by the learned and judicious Dr. Owen, agreeably to
the sense we have given of the word; I have no occasion to
make any other critical remarks upon it, by referring to those
writings in which the word is found<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c012'><sup>[88]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>But, since the greatest number of christians are not so well
versed in the Greek language, as to be able to judge whether
those methods of reasoning that are taken from the use of the
word which we render <i>baptize</i>, are sufficiently conclusive:
And, when it is asserted, that many who are undoubtedly very
good masters of the Greek tongue, have determined that it
signifies all manner of washing with water, as well as dipping
into it, this will be reckoned, by them, a very fruitless and
unprofitable subject; however, we are obliged to mention it,
because great stress is usually laid on the sense of this word,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>to establish that mode of baptism which is always used by
those who are on the other side of the question.</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall take leave to add, to what that learned author, but
now quoted, refers to, has observed on this subject; that it
does not appear to me that the word Βαπτιζω always signifies to
wash, by dipping into water, but by the application of water
some other way; because it is sometimes applied to those
things which were too large and cumbersome, and therefore
could not well be cleansed that way. Thus it is said, in Mark
vii. 4. that <i>the Pharisees</i> not only <i>held the washing</i>, or, as it is
in the Greek, <i>the baptism of cups and pots, and brazen vessels</i>,
which might, indeed, be washed by immersion, but of <i>tables</i>,
or, as it may be rendered, of <i>beds</i>, or those seats on which the
Jews, according to the custom of the eastern nations, lay at
their ease, when they eat their meals. These, I conceive were
washed some other way, different from that of dipping or
plunging in water; And if it was possible that they might be
washed that way, yet the word may be applied to innumerable
things, that cannot be baptized by immersion: Therefore, the
general sense that we have given of it, that it signifies to wash,
whether by dipping into the water, or by the application of
water to the thing washed, may justify our practice, with respect
to the mode of baptism, commonly used by us.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> 1. It is objected hereunto, that the mode used by us,
is not properly baptism, but rantism; or, that to sprinkle, or
pour, is not to baptize.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that this method of begging
the question in controversy, is never reckoned a fair way
of arguing. If baptism be a using the means of cleansing,
by the application of water, which is the thing we contend for,
then the word <i>baptize</i> may as well be applied to it as to any
other mode of washing. That which may be further replied
to this objection is, that if the thing signified by the action of
baptizing, namely, the blood of Jesus, together with those
gifts and graces of the Spirit, which are applied to those to
whom God makes this a saving ordinance, be sometimes set
forth by sprinkling or pouring clean water upon a person, then
it cannot be well concluded, that sprinkling, or pouring, is not
baptizing, though it differ very much from that which they
who contend with us about this matter generally call baptizing.
That sprinkling or pouring, is sometimes used in scripture, to
signify the conferring of those spiritual gifts and graces which
are signified in baptism, is very evident; inasmuch as it is
said in John i. 17. <i>The blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanseth
us from all sin</i>; and this is called <i>the blood of sprinkling</i>, in
Heb. xii. 24. 1 Pet. i. 2. Therefore, in a spiritual sense,
sprinkling is called cleansing from sin; and the graces of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Spirit conferred in regeneration, are represented in Ezek.
xxxvi. 25-27. by <i>sprinkling clean water</i>; which mode of
speaking would never be used, were not sprinkling a means of
cleansing. And, some think, that the apostle when he speaks
of our <i>drawing near to God, having our bodies washed with
pure water</i>, Heb. x. 22, intends the ordinance of baptism; yet
it alludes to the ceremonial cleansings that were under the law,
which were often done by sprinkling: Therefore we cannot
but assert, that sprinkling water in baptism, is as much cleansing
as any other mode used therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, sometimes the thing signified in baptism, is represented
by a metaphor taken from pouring; which, if our
mode of baptizing be just, will not seem disagreeable to it;
and, it may be, the explication is taken from it, as the conferring
the Holy Ghost, which they who were baptized were
given to expect, is often called <i>pouring out the Spirit</i>, Acts
ii. 17, 18. chap. viii. 38.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> There is another objection which is concluded by many,
to be unanswerable, viz. that when we read of baptism in the
New Testament, the person baptized is said to <i>go down into
the water</i>. Thus the Eunich did, chap. viii. 38. and immediately
after this, he is said to <i>come up out of the water</i>; which
can be applied, as is supposed, to no other mode of baptism
but that of immersion.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that the whole strength of
this objection depends upon the sense that is given of the
Greek particles, which we often render <i>into</i>, and <i>out of</i><a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c012'><sup>[90]</sup></a>. But
this will have no weight with any but those who are unacquainted
with the Greek language, since it is so well known
to all that understand it, that the former of these particles often
signifies <i>to</i>, as well as <i>into</i>; and the latter <i>from</i>, as well as
<i>out of</i>; as innumerable instances might easily be given, was it
needful, from scripture, and other Greek authors, in which the
words are applied to those things, that according to the natural
signification thereof, cannot be understood as denoting <i>into</i>,
or <i>out of</i>. There is one scripture which no one can suppose
is to be taken in any other sense but what is agreeable to our
present purpose, <i>viz.</i> Mat. xvii. 27. wherein our Saviour bids
Peter <i>Go to the sea<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c012'><sup>[91]</sup></a>, and cast an hook, and take the fish that
first cometh thence</i>, &amp;c. where, by <i>go to the sea</i>, we can understand
nothing else, but go to the sea-shore; and yet the word
is the same with that which is, in some other places, rendered
<i>into</i>. There are other scriptures in which persons are said to
<i>go to the mountain</i>, or some other places, wherein it would be
very improper to say, that they went into the place; though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the word be the same with that which in other instances we
render <i>into</i>. And the word<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c012'><sup>[92]</sup></a> which is sometimes rendered
<i>out of</i>, is frequently rendered <i>from</i>, and can be understood in
no other sense: As when it is said, in Luke xi. 31. <i>The
queen of the south came from the utmost parts of the earth, to
hear the wisdom of Solomon</i>; which cannot be understood of
her coming <i>out of</i>, but <i>from</i> thence. But, this matter being
so well known to all that read the New Testament in the original,
it is needless for me to give any other instances.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>As to what concerns the Eunuch’s <i>going into the water</i>, I
cannot think any thing else is intended by it, but that he descended
or lighted down from his chariot, to the water, that is,
by a metonymy, to the water-side, in order to his being baptized
by Philip. It is no uncommon mode of speaking, to
say, that a person goes down to the river-side, to take water,
or to the well, to draw it; therefore, this is no strain on the
sense of the word; and I am the rather inclined to give into
this opinion, because some modern travellers, taking notice of
the place where this was done, intimate, that it was only a spring
of water; and therefore without sufficient depth to plunge the
body in: And some ancient writers, who lived between three
and four hundred years after our Saviour’s time, as Jerom and
Eusebius, intimate the same thing. If it be said, that these
may be mistaken as to the place, inasmuch as the particular
spot of ground in which this water was, is not mentioned in
scripture: I will not lay much stress upon it; however, I cannot
but observe, that it is represented by a diminutive expression,
as it is said, they <i>came to a certain water</i>, that is,
probably, a brook, which was by the way-side; not a river, or
a great collection of water. And it is further observed, that
Philip, as well as the Eunuch, <i>went down into the water</i>;
though none suppose that he was plunged in the water; therefore
it does not certainly appear, from the sense of the word,
that the Eunuch was, unless the matter in controversy be taken
for granted, that baptism can be performed in no other way,
but by plunging.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, <i>to go down to the water</i>, does not always signify
in other scriptures, going down to the bottom of the water; as
when the Psalmist, in Psal. cvii. 23. speaks of them that <i>go down
to the sea in ships</i>, he does not mean them that go down to the
bottom of it; therefore, going down to the water does not always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>signify being plunged in it. As for what is said concerning
Philip and the eunuch’s <i>coming up out of the water</i>, it may very
fairly be understood of their returning from the water-side, and
the eunuch’s going up again into his chariot. Moreover, I cannot
but think, that in this, and all other places, where persons
are said to <i>come up out of the water</i>, it denotes an action performed
with design, and the perfect exercise of the understanding
in him that does it; which seems not agreeable to one
who is at the bottom of the water, and cannot well come up
from thence, unless by the help of him that baptized him. The
sense of the words, <i>coming out of the water</i>, is agreeable to
what is said concerning our Saviour at his baptism, in Matt.
iii. 16. <i>Jesus went up straightway out of the water</i>; which
seems to be a mistake in our translation; where the words
απὸ τοῦ ὑδαλος, have been rendered, <i>from the water</i>; which is of the
same import with the sense of the Greek particle ἐκ when a
person is said to <i>come up out of the water</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 3. It seems very evident, that John the Baptist used
no other mode but that of immersion; because he chose those
places to exercise this part of his ministry in, that were well
supplied with water, sufficient for this purpose. Accordingly,
we first read of his removing from the <i>wilderness of Judea</i>, in
which he <i>preached the doctrine of repentance</i>; and told the
people, that <i>the kingdom of heaven</i>, that is, the gospel-state,
which was to begin with the appearing of the Messiah, <i>was
at hand</i>; and then we read of his removing to the banks of the
river Jordan, for the conveniency of baptizing those who came
to him for that purpose: And, after that, we read of another
station in which he resided, <i>viz.</i> <i>Enon, near to Salim</i>; and this
reason is assigned; <i>because there was much water there</i>, John
iii. 23. Now, if he had baptized by sprinkling, or pouring a
little water on the face, he had no need to remove out of the
<i>wilderness of Judea</i>: For, whatever scarcity of water there
might be there, it was no difficult matter for him to be supplied
with enough to serve his occasion, had this been his
mode of baptizing.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that though John removed
to Jordan and Ænon, that he might be well supplied with
water, as he daily wanted large quantities thereof; yet it doth
not necessarily follow from hence, that this was done for the
sake of immersion therein: And it doth not sufficiently appear
to me, that Ænon afforded water deep enough for a person to
be baptized in it after this manner; for it seems to be but a
small tract of land, in which it is hardly probable, that there
were many lakes, or rivers of water contained; which is as
much as can be said concerning a well watered country.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>Therefore, I think, the words<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a> ought to have been rendered
<i>many waters</i>; by which we are to understand, as Dr. Lightfoot
observes, that it was a place of springs<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a>, or small brooks of
water. This place John chose, that he might be supplied with
water for his use; but it doth not, I think, necessarily, follow
from hence, that he baptized by immersion; Besides, if there
had been a great collection of waters there, there would have
been some indications thereof at this day; which, I believe, it
would be hard to prove that there are.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the other part of the objection, that it was a very easy
matter for him to have been supplied with water in the wilderness
of Judea, to baptize by sprinkling or pouring, by his having
it brought to him in vessels for that purpose: It may be replied,
that if he had only poured water on the head or face,
there is no need to suppose that he was so sparing of it, as
not to use above a spoonful, especially when it was so easy a
matter for him, by his removing to another station, to be better
supplied. If there was but a little water poured on every one
that came to be baptized by him, it would require a very great
quantity of water to baptize the vast multitudes that came to
him; inasmuch as it is said, that <i>Jerusalem, and all Judea, and
all the region round about Jordan, were baptized of him</i>: It is
one thing for a little water to be brought in a bason to baptize
a person or two, and another thing for this to be done in the
case under our present consideration. Moreover, it is certain,
that in hot countries, and particularly in Judea; and more especially
in the wilderness thereof, there was a very great scarcity
of water; accordingly we read, sometimes, that water was so
valuable a thing, that it was reckoned a very considerable part
of a man’s estate: Thus Isaac was envied by the Philistines,
for all the wells his father’s servants had digged; and then we
read of their stopping them up, and his digging other wells;
and also of the strife between the herdsmen of Gerar, and his
herdsmen, for the possession thereof, Gen. xxvi. 14,-20. And
we read, in Gen. xxi. 14,-16. that when Abraham sent Hagar
away from him with Ishmael, he gave her <i>bread</i>, and a <i>bottle
of water</i>; and <i>when the water was spent in the bottle, she cast
the child under one of the shrubs</i>, despairing of his life; which
she need not have done, if water was so easy to come by as it
is supposed in this objection. It is certain, that a person may
travel many miles without finding water to quench his thirst, in
those desert places. This farther appears from Samson’s being
<i>ready to die for thirst</i>, after the great victory he had obtained
over the Philistines, on which occasion God wrought a miracle
to supply him, Judges xv. 18, 19, which can hardly be accounted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>for, if there had been so great plenty of water in that country,
as there is in ours; this then, I apprehend to be the reason
of John’s removal to Jordan and Ænon; therefore it doth not
necessarily prove that his design was to baptize in that way that
is pleaded for by those on the other side of the question.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, as it doth not sufficiently appear to me, from any
thing contained in the objection, that John used immersion in
baptism, so it seems most agreeable, to some circumstances that
attended it, to conclude that he did not; inasmuch as there was
no conveniency for the change of their garments, nor servants
appointed to help them therein; which seems necessary to answer
this occasion. And some have supposed, that it might
endanger the health of those who were infirm among them, and
John’s much more, who was obliged to stand many days together
in the water, or, at least, the greatest part thereof, while
he was administering this ordinance. And they who were
baptized must immediately retire when the ordinance was over,
or it would endanger their health; unless we have recourse to
a dispensation of providence, that is next to miraculous:
Though I am sensible, some say, that none ever suffered hereby
in our day; which, if the observation be true, is a kind
providence that they ought to be thankful for.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if, after all that has been said on this matter, it will not
be allowed that baptism signifies any thing else but dipping in
water: Then I might farther allege, that this might be done by
dipping the face, which is the principal part of the body, without
plunging the whole body; and this might answer the design
of the ordinance as well as the other; since it is not the
quantity used in a sacramental sign that is so much to be regarded,
as the action performed, together with the matter of it;
if the smallest piece of bread, and a spoonful of wine are used
in the Lord’s supper, this is generally reckoned as well adapted
to answer the design of the ordinance, as if a great quantity of
each were received by every one that partakes of it. Now, as
to what concerns our present argument, the washing a part of
the body is deemed sufficient to signify the thing intended, as
much as though the whole body had been washed. Thus when
our Saviour washed his disciples’ feet, and told Peter, <i>If</i> he
<i>washed him not, he had no part in him</i>, John xiii. 5. wherein
(by the way) we may observe, that he calls washing his feet,
washing him, by a synecdoche, for a part of the whole; upon
which occasion Peter replies, <i>not my feet only, but also my hands
and my head</i>; and Jesus answered, <i>He that is washed needeth
not, save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit</i>, ver. 10. by
which, I think, he intends, that this signifies that cleansing,
which is the spiritual meaning thereof, as much as though the
whole body had been washed with water; for though one design
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>hereof might be to teach them humility, and brotherly
kindness; yet it also signifies their being washed or cleansed by
his blood and Spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 4. There is another objection on which very much
stress is generally laid, which I should not do justice to the
cause I am maintaining, if I should wholly pass it over, taken
from what the apostle says, in Rom. vi. 3, 4, 5. <i>so many of us
as were baptized into Christ Jesus, were baptized into his death:
Therefore we were buried with him by baptism<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a> into death;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>that, like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of
the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we
shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.</i> From whence
it is argued, that there ought to be a similitude between the
sign and the thing signified; and, consequently, that baptism
should be performed in such a way, that, by being covered
with water, there might be a resemblance of Christ’s burial;
and by being lifted up out of the water, a resemblance of his
resurrection: Therefore this ordinance doth not only signify
the using the means of cleansing with water, but the mode,
namely, being plunged, or, as it were, buried in water.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied, that it is not agreeable to
the nature of a sacramental sign, in any other instance; that
there should be an analogy between the thing done, and what
is signified thereby, any otherwise than by divine appointment.
Accordingly we observed, in the foregoing answer, that a sacrament
has not a natural tendency to signify Christ, and his
benefits; as the eating bread and drinking wine doth not signify
the body and blood of Christ, any otherwise than as this
signification is annexed by our Saviour, to the action performed;
the same, I think, may be applied to baptism; especially
our consecration, and dedication to God therein; and if any
other external sign had been instituted, to signify the blessings
of the covenant of grace, we should have been as much obliged
to make use of it as we were of water. Therefore, I conceive,
the apostle, in this scripture, mentioned in the objection, doth
not refer to our being buried in water, or taken out of it, as a
natural sign of Christ’s burial and resurrection; but our having
communion with him in his burial and resurrection. This, I
think, would hardly be denied by many, on the other side of
the question, did not the objection, but now mentioned, and the
cause they maintain, render it expedient for them to understand
the words in another sense. This is all that I shall
say with respect to this matter in controversy, as to the subjects
and mode of baptism; in which, as I should have been
unfaithful, had I said less to it; so I have not the least inclination
to treat those that differ from me in an unfriendly way,
as having a just sense of their harmony with us, especially a
great part of them, in those doctrines that have a more immediate
reference to our salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall now proceed to consider, that as there are some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>who appear to be grossly ignorant of the thing signified in baptism,
who seem to engage in it, as though it were not a divine
institution, concluding it to be little more than an external rite
or form to be used in giving the child a name, being induced
hereto rather by custom, than a sense of the obligation they are
under, to give up their children to God by faith therein; so
there are others who attribute too much to it, when they assert,
that infants are hereby regenerated; and that if they die before
they commit actual sin, they are undoubtedly saved, inasmuch
as they are hereby made members of Christ, children of God,
and heirs of the kingdom of heaven: This seems to be an
ascribing that to the ordinance, which is rather expected or
desired, than conferred thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the child’s being signed with the sign of the cross,
signifying hereby that he should not be ashamed to confess
the faith of Christ crucified, but manfully to fight under his
banner against sin, the world, and the devil; how much soever
this may be a branch of that baptismal obligation, which he is
professedly under; yet I cannot see what warrant persons have
to make use of this external sign and symbol, which can be
reckoned no other than an ordinance for their faith, though
destitute of a divine institution.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is also another thing practised by some in baptism,
that is greatly abused, namely, the requiring that some should
be appointed as sureties for the child, by whom it is personated;
and they engage, in a solemn manner, in its behalf, that it shall
fulfil the obligation that it is laid under, which is not only more
than what is in their power to perform; but it is to be feared,
that the greatest part of these sureties hardly think themselves
obliged to shew any concern about them afterward. And that
which is farther exceptionable in this matter, is that the parents,
who are more immediately obliged to give up their children
to God, seem to be, as it were, excluded from having any hand
in this matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have nothing to except against the first rise of this practice;
which was in the second century, when the church was
under persecution; and the design thereof was laudable and
good, namely, that if the parents should die before the child
came of age; whereby it would be in danger of being seized
on by the Heathen, and trained up in their superstitious
and idolatrous mode of worship, the sureties promised, that,
in this case, they would deal with it as though it were their
own child, and, bring it up in the Christian religion; which
kind and pious concern for its welfare, might have been better
expressed at some other time than in baptism, lest this should
be thought an appendix to that ordinance: However, through
the goodness of God, the children of believing parents are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>reduced to those hazardous circumstances; and therefore the
obligation to do this, is less needful; but to vow, and not perform,
is not only useless to the child, but renders that only a
matter of form, which they promise to do in this sacred ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only thing that I shall add under this answer, is, that
if we have been baptized, either in our infancy, or when adult,
we are obliged, in faithfulness, as we value our own souls, to
improve it to the glory of God, and our spiritual welfare in the
whole conduct of our lives. And this leads us to what is contained
in the following answer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXVII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXVII.</span> <i>How is baptism to be improved by us?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The needful, but much neglected duty of improving
our baptism, is to be performed by us all our life long; especially
in the time of temptation, and when we are present
at the administration of it to others, by serious and thankful
consideration of the nature of it, and of the ends for which
Christ instituted it, the privileges and benefits conferred and
sealed thereby, and our solemn vow made therein, by being
humbled for our sinful defilement, our falling short of, and
walking contrary to the grace of baptism and our engagements,
by growing up to assurance of pardon of sin, and of
all other blessings sealed to us in that sacrament, by drawing
strength from the death and resurrection of Christ, into
whom we are baptized, for the mortifying of sin, and quickening
of grace, and by endeavouring to live by faith, to have
our conversation in holiness and righteousness, as those that
have therein given up their names to Christ, and to walk
in brotherly love, as being baptized by the same Spirit, into
one body.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this answer we may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. That our baptism, together with the engagements which
we are therein laid under to be the Lord’s, is to be improved
by us; though this duty be too much neglected. That it ought
to be improved is evident, inasmuch as it is an ordinance, or
means of grace, for our attaining spiritual blessings; therefore
we are not only guilty of a sinful neglect, but we lose the advantage
that might be expected thereby, if we do not improve
it so as to answer the valuable end thereof; and when we consider
it as a professed dedication to God, as has been before
observed, or a bond and obligation laid on us, to be entirely,
and for ever, his, it cannot but be reckoned the highest affront
offered to the divine Majesty, and a being unstedfast in his covenant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>for us practically to disown the engagement, or, in effect,
to deny his right to us. Now, it is farther observed, that
this duty is much neglected, and the reason hereof is,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Because many have very low thoughts of this ordinance,
and understand not the spiritual intent or meaning thereof, nor
what it is to improve it. These reckon it no more than an external
rite, established by custom, and commonly observed in
a Christian nation, without duly weighing the end and design
for which it was instituted, or what is signified thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Others suppose, that there is nothing in it but a public
declaration, that the person baptized is made a Christian, or
has that character put upon him; but they know not what it
is to be a Christian indeed, being utter strangers to the life
and power of religion, and the spiritual blessings hoped for,
or, through the grace of God, consequent upon our baptismal
dedication.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Others have, indeed, right apprehensions of the sign and
the thing signified thereby, yet through the prevalency of corruption,
and the pride and deceitfulness of their hearts, they
do not fiducially give up themselves to God, nor desire the spiritual
and saving blessings of the covenant of grace. These
therefore do not improve their baptism; and, it is to be feared,
that this is the condition and character of the greatest number
of professors: Which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. How baptism is to be improved by us, and that in several
cases,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. When we are present, at the administration of it to others.
We are not, indeed, at that time, so immediately concerned
in the ordinance, as the person who is publicly devoted
to God therein. Nevertheless, we are not to behave ourselves
as unconcerned spectators; and therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) We are to join herein with suitable acts of faith and
prayer, as the nature of the ordinance calls for them, and to
adore the persons of the Godhead whose name and glory is
mentioned therein. And we are to apply ourselves to God,
for the grace of the covenant, that is signified thereby, that he
would be our God, as well as the God of the person who is
particularly given up to him in baptism. We are also to bewail
the universal depravity of human nature, and that guilt
which we bring with us into the world, which is signified in
infant-baptism; and this, together with the habits of sin, which
we have contracted, is confessed by those who are baptized
when adult, which we cannot but see a great deal of, in our
daily experience. We ought also to entertain becoming
thoughts of the virtue of the blood of Christ, and of the power
of the Holy Ghost, which alone can take away the guilt of
sin, and render this ordinance effectual to salvation; which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>are not only to desire with respect to the person baptized, but
that we ourselves may be made partakers of that grace, which
we equally stand in need of.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We ought to confess before God, with sorrow and
shame, how defective we have been, as to the improvement of
our baptismal engagements; so that, though we have been devoted
to him, our hearts and affections have been very prone
to depart from him; and we ought to adore and acknowledge
the goodness and faithfulness of God, in that, though we have
been unstedfast in his covenant, through the treachery and deceitfulness
of our hearts; yet he has been ever mindful thereof,
and made good the promises contained therein, to all his
servants who have put their trust in him.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Our baptism is to be improved by us in the time of temptation,
in order to our resisting it, and preventing our being entangled
and overcome thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) If the temptation takes its rise from the world, or we
are thereby induced to lay aside, or be remiss in our duty to
God, from the prosperous circumstances in which we are therein,
we should consider, that in having been devoted to God in
our infancy, or given up ourselves professedly to him, when adult,
it has been intimated and acknowledged, that he is our
portion, better to us than all we can enjoy in the world; and
therefore we ought to acquiesce in him as such, and say, <i>Whom
have I in heaven but thee; and there is none</i>, or nothing, <i>upon
the earth that I desire besides thee</i>, Psal. lxxiii. 25.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, if we are tempted to be uneasy, and repine at the
providence of God, by reason of the many evils that befal us
in the world, we ought to consider, that when we were given
up to God, this implied in it an obligation to be content to be
at his disposal, and to be satisfied with whatever he allots for
us, as not questioning the care and justice of his providence,
in which we were under an indispensable obligation to acquiesce.
Therefore when God tries us, by bringing us under various
afflictions, our baptismal engagement obliges us to say,
It is the Lord, let him do with us what seemeth good in his
sight.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) If we are exposed to the temptations of Satan, or those
inward suggestions, whereby sinful objects are presented to
our thoughts, and a false gloss put upon them, to induce us to
a compliance therewith, we are to improve our baptismal engagement,
by considering that it contains a solemn acknowledgment
of God’s right to us, exclusive of all others: therefore,
we cannot but dread the thoughts of submitting to be vassals
to Satan, which is, in effect, to disown that allegiance which
we owe to God, and to say, that other lords shall have dominion
over us. This will have a tendency to induce us to adhere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>stedfastly to God, as the result of our having been devoted
to him in this ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>And if we are afraid of being ensnared by those wiles and
methods of deceit, which Satan often makes use of, that are
not always discerned by us, we are to consider ourselves as
having been devoted to Christ; and, pursuant thereunto, if we
have, in any instance, improved this solemn transaction, we
have given up ourselves to him, in hope of being under his protection,
and interested in his intercession, so that though we
are <i>sifted as wheat</i>, our <i>faith</i> may <i>not fail</i>, Luke xxii. 31, 32.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, when we are assaulted, and, as it were, wounded
with Satan’s fiery darts, whereby great discouragements are
thrown in our way, the guilt of sin magnified, as though it
were unpardonable, and the stain and pollution thereof such,
as can never be washed away: And when we are ready to
conclude from hence, that our state is hopeless, and the comforts
we once enjoyed, irrecoverably lost; this is, indeed, an
afflictive case. Nevertheless, our baptism is to be improved
by us, as considering that remission of sins was the blessing
desired and hoped for, inasmuch as it was signified thereby;
so that we are to be sensible that the blood of Christ cleanseth
from all sin; and that, as we were given up to him, in hope of
obtaining this privilege, and have been enabled since then, to
give up ourselves to him by faith, and therein to improve our
baptismal engagement; we therefore trust, that he will appear
for us, rebuke the adversary, establish our comforts, and enable
us to walk as those, who desire to recommend his grace to others,
that they may be encouraged to adhere to him, by the
comfortable sense which we have of his love shed abroad in
our hearts, by the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Our baptismal engagement is to be improved by us, before
and after we are brought into a converted state.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Unregenerate persons are to improve it, as it should
afford them matter of deep humiliation, that though they have
been devoted to God, and thereby were called by his name,
and made partakers of the external blessings of his covenant;
yet they have been alienated from the life of God, and strangers
to the internal saving blessings thereof. There was a profession
made, in baptism, that they stood in need of Christ’s mediation,
to deliver them from the guilt of sin, and of being
cleansed from the pollution thereof, which is of a spreading
nature; but they have, notwithstanding, given way to it; and,
how <i>pure</i> soever they have been <i>in their own eyes, are not yet
washed from their filthiness</i>, Prov. xxx. 12. Now such may
take occasion from hence to plead earnestly with God for converting
grace; which is the only means whereby they may
know that he has accepted of their solemn dedication to him;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>or that they are not only born of water, but of the Spirit; and
are made partakers of the thing signified in baptism, without
which, the external sign will not afford any saving advantage.
We may also plead with God, that as we are professedly his,
he would assert his own right to us, overcome us to himself,
and make us <i>willing in the day of his power</i>, Psal. cx. 3.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Our baptismal engagement is constantly to be improved
by us, if we are brought into a state of grace, in order to
the growth and increase thereof; especially if we are sensible
of great declension therein, or that it is not, in all respects with
us, as it once was; if we are sensible of deadness and stupidity,
in holy duties, and stand in need of being quickened, excited,
and brought into a lively frame of spirit, or to be restored
after great back-slidings; if we would have sin mortified,
and the secret workings thereof in our heart subdued, we
ought to consider, that having been <i>baptized into Jesus Christ</i>,
we were <i>baptized into his death</i>; and that we are obliged hereby
to <i>walk in newness of life</i>; therefore <i>sin should not reign in
our mortal bodies</i>, Rom. vi. 3, 4, 12. And as we hope and trust,
that we are made partakers of the saving blessings signified in
this ordinance, we desire to improve the relation we stand in
to Christ, as his people, as a matter of encouragement, that
when we are oppressed, he will undertake for us.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we are destitute of assurance of his love, and our interest
in him, we are to improve the consideration of our being his,
not only by professed dedication, but by a fiducial adherence
to him; this will encourage us to hope that he will enable us
to walk holily and comfortably before him, and lift up the light
of his countenance upon us, as our reconciled God and Father.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, in the whole course of our conversation it will be of
use, for the promoting the life of faith, which consists in an
entire dependance on him, as those who are sensible that we
can do nothing without him, to consider, that when we were
first devoted to him, it was acknowledged, and from the time,
wherein we have been enabled to give up ourselves to him by
faith, we have been always sensible that we stand in need of
daily supplies of grace from him, as all our springs are in him.
Moreover, our baptismal engagement is to be improved, as it
is an inducement to us to have our conversation in holiness
and righteousness; whereby practical religion will be promoted
in all its branches, when we consider that we are not our own,
and therefore dare not think of living as we list, or serving divers
lusts and pleasures, but that we are obliged to make his
revealed will (whose we are, and whom we desire to serve,)
the rule of all our actions.</p>

<p class='c006'>And lastly, we ought to walk in brotherly love, as being <i>baptized
by the Spirit into one body</i>, 1 Cor. xii. 13. They who are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>partakers of the saving blessings signified by baptism, have
ground to conclude themselves members of Christ’s mystical
body, or the invisible church, of which he is the head. This
is a spiritual baptism, being the effect of divine power, and the
special work of the Holy Ghost; and certainly this will be an
inducement to all who are partakers thereof, to walk together
in brotherly love, as those who are favoured with the same privileges,
and hope to enjoy that complete blessedness, in which
they, who are before devoted to Christ, shall be for ever with
him. Thus concerning the ordinance of baptism.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now we are led to speak concerning the sacrament of
the Lord’s supper, which is considered either absolutely in itself,
or as compared with baptism. And accordingly it is enquired;
wherein they agree, or differ. In considering the nature
of the Lord’s supper, it is farther enquired; how they,
who are to partake of it, ought to prepare themselves for it before
they engage therein? And there are also two cases of conscience
answered; the one respecting those who are not satisfied
concerning their meetness for it; the other respecting those
who ought to be kept from it. We have also an account of
the duties of communicants, while they are engaged in this ordinance;
or those that are incumbent on them, after they have
attended on it. These things are particularly insisted on in
several following answers, which we are now led to consider.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXVIII., CLXIX., CLXX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXVIII.</span> <i>What is the Lord’s Supper?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The Lord’s supper is a sacrament of the New Testament,
wherein by giving and receiving bread and wine, according
to the appointment of Jesus Christ, his death is shewed
forth; and they that worthily communicate, feed upon
his body and blood, to their spiritual nourishment and
growth in grace, have their union and communion with him
confirmed, testify and renew their thankfulness, and engagement
to God, and their mutual love and fellowship each
with other, as members of the same mystical body.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXIX.</span> <i>How hath Christ appointed bread and wine
to be given and received in the sacrament of the Lord’s supper?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Christ hath appointed the ministers of his word, in the
administration of this sacrament of the Lord’s supper, to set
apart the bread and wine from common use, by the word of
institution, thanksgiving, and prayer, to take and break the
bread, and to give both the bread, and the wine to the communicants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>who are, by the same appointment, to take, and
eat the bread, and to drink the wine, in thankful remembrance,
that the body of Christ was broken and given, and
his blood shed for them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXX.</span> <i>How do they that worthily communicate in
the Lord’s supper, feed upon the body and blood of Christ
therein?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> As the body and blood of Christ are not corporally or
carnally present in, with, or under the bread and wine in the
Lord’s supper, and yet are spiritually present to the faith of
the receiver, no less truly and really than the elements themselves
are to their outward senses; so they that worthily
communicate in the sacrament of the Lord’s supper, do
therein feed upon the body and blood of Christ, not after a
corporal, or carnal, but in a spiritual manner, yet truly and
really, while by faith they receive and apply unto themselves
Christ crucified, and all the benefits of his death.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are several things contained in these answers, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>I. The general description of this ordinance, as it is called
a sacrament of the New Testament; in which we shall be
led to speak concerning the person by whom it was instituted
in common with other ordinances; and that is our Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We shall consider the persons by whom it is to be administered,
namely, the ministers, or pastors of particular
churches; inasmuch as it is an ordinance given only to those
who are in church-communion.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We have an account of the matter thereof, or the outward
elements, to wit, bread and wine.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. We shall consider the ministers act, antecedent to the
church’s partaking of this ordinance, in setting apart the elements
from a common to a sacred use; which is to be done
by the word and prayer, joined with thanksgiving.</p>

<p class='c006'>V. We have an account of the actions, both of the minister
and people; the one breaks the bread, and pours out the wine.
In order to their being distributed among those who are to receive
them; the other, to wit, the communicants, partake of
them, and join with him in eating the bread, and drinking the
wine.</p>

<p class='c006'>VI. We are to consider what is signified hereby, namely,
the body and blood of Christ; which are not supposed to be
corporally and carnally, but spiritually present to the faith of
the receivers, upon which account they may be said to feed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>upon the body and blood of Christ, and apply the benefits of
his death to themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>VII. We have an account of the persons who hope to enjoy
these privileges, and partake of the Lord’s supper in a right
manner; these are said worthily to communicate; as also the
ends which they ought to have in view, namely, their spiritual
nourishment, and growth in grace, their enjoying communion
with Christ; and that love that they are obliged to express to
each other, as members of the same mystical body.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. It is an ordinance of the New Testament, instituted by
our Saviour. That it is an ordinance, is evident, in that it is
founded on a divine command; as appears from the words of
institution, in Matt. xxvi. 26, 27. <i>Take eat, this is my body;
and he took the cup, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all
of it</i>, &amp;c. And this is also intimated by the apostle, when,
speaking particularly concerning it, as also the manner in
which it is to be performed, he says, <i>I have received of the
Lord, that which also I delivered unto you</i>, 1 Cor. xi. 23.
Moreover, there is a blessing annexed to our partaking of it
in a right manner; which may plainly be inferred from the apostle’s
distinguishing those who receive it <i>worthily</i>, from others
that receive it <i>unworthily</i>, or in an unbecoming manner;
of whom the former are said to <i>come together for the better</i>,
the latter <i>for the worse</i>, ver. 17. and to partake of the Lord’s
supper for the better, is to partake of it for our spiritual advantage,
which supposes, that there are some blessings annexed
to it, which render it not only a duty, but an ordinance, or
means of grace. And, that it is a gospel-ordinance of the
New Testament, appears from the time of its being instituted
by our Saviour, as well as the end and design thereof. It is
particularly intimated, that Christ instituted this ordinance immediately
before his last sufferings, as a memorial of his dying
love. Thus the apostle says, <i>The same night in which he was
betrayed, he took bread</i>, ver. 23. And that it was designed to
continue as a standing ordinance in the church throughout all
ages, appears from what he farther adds, <i>As often as ye eat
this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death, till
he come</i>, ver. 26.</p>

<p class='c006'>The contrary to this is maintained by some modern enthusiasts,
who deny it to be an ordinance, as they also do baptism;
concluding that no ceremony, or significant sign, is consistent
with the gospel-dispensation. And as for what the apostle
says concerning our <i>shewing forth the Lord’s death till he come</i>,
they suppose, that hereby is meant, till he comes by the effusion
of the Spirit; and therefore, if it was an ordinance at
first, it ceased to be so when the Spirit was poured forth on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>the church, in the beginning of the gospel-dispensation. To
this it may be replied,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That ceremonial institutions are not inconsistent with the
gospel-dispensation, inasmuch as they may not be designed to
signify some benefits to be procured by Christ, as they did,
which were instituted under the ceremonial law; but they may
be considered as rememorative signs of the work of redemption,
which has been brought to perfection by him.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. When the apostle, in the scripture but now mentioned,
says, that <i>we shew the Lord’s death till he come</i>, it cannot be
meant concerning his coming in the plentiful effusion of the
Spirit; inasmuch as this privilege was conferred on the church
in the apostle’s days, at the same time, when he speaks of their
shewing forth his death. Therefore, doubtless, he intends
thereby Christ’s second coming, when this, and all other ordinances,
which are now observed in the church, as adapted to
the present imperfect state thereof, shall cease; we must therefore
conclude from hence, that it was designed to be continued
in the church in all ages, as it is at this day.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We are to consider the persons by whom this ordinance
is to be administered; and these are only such as are lawfully
called, and set apart to the pastoral office, whose work is to
feed the church, not only by the preaching of the word, but
by the administration of the sacraments, which are ordinances
for their faith, in which they are said to receive, and spiritually
feed upon Christ and his benefits; upon which account God
promises to <i>give his people pastors according to his own heart,
who should feed them with knowledge and understanding</i>, Jer.
iii. 15. Now that none but these are appointed to administer
this ordinance, is evident in that they, who partake of it, are
said to have communion with him, and with one another therein,
for their mutual edification and spiritual advantage; therefore
it doth not belong to mankind in general, but the church
in particular. And, to prevent confusion therein, Christ has
appointed one, or more proper officers in his churches, to
whom the management of this work is committed; who are
called hereunto, by the providence of God, and the consent and
desire of the church, to whom they are to minister.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We are now to consider the matter, or the outward elements
to be used in the Lord’s supper; and these are bread
and wine. Thus it is said, <i>Jesus took bread</i>, Matt. xxvi. 26.
and <i>he also took the cup</i>; which, by a metonymy, is put for the
wine: For, our Saviour referring to this action, speaks of his
<i>drinking the fruit of the vine</i>, ver. 29. As for the bread that
is to be used in this ordinance, there was a very warm debate
between the Latin and Greek church concerning it; the former,
as the Papists do at this day, concluding it absolutely necessary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>that it should be unleavened bread, inasmuch as that
kind of bread was used by our Lord, when he first instituted
it, which was at the time of the passover, when no leaven was
to be found in their houses. And they make it also a significant
sign of the sincerity and truth with which the Lord’s supper
ought to be eaten; for which, they refer to what the apostle
says, in 1 Cor. v. 8. <i>Let as keep the feast, not with old leaven,
neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with
the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</i> But this seems
only to be an allusion to the use of unleavened bread in the
passover; which, it may be, might have a typical reference to
that sincerity and truth with which all the ordinances of God
are to be engaged in; but it does not sufficiently appear that
he intends hereby that the bread used in the Lord’s supper
should be of this kind, or, that it was designed to signify the
frame of spirit with which this ordinance is to be celebrated.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other hand, the Greek church thought that the bread
ought to be leavened, according to our common practice at this
day, it being the same that was used at other times. And this
seems most eligible, as it puts a just difference between the
bread used in the passover, which was a part of the ceremonial
law, and a gospel-institution, that is distinct from it. But,
I think, there is no need to debate either side of the question
with too much warmth, it being a matter of no great importance.
As for the wine that is to be used in this ordinance, it
is a necessary part thereof; and therefore the Papists are guilty
of sacrilege in withholding the cup from the common people<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c012'><sup>[97]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. We are now to consider what the minister is to do, antecedent
to the church’s partaking of the Lord’s supper: He
is to set apart the outward elements of bread and wine from
a common, to this particular holy use. Upon which account
it may be said to be <i>sanctified by the word of God and prayer</i>,
1 Tim. iv. 5. The words of institution contain an intimation
that these elements are to be used in this ordinance, by Christ’s
appointment; without which, no significant sign could be used
in any religious matters. And, as for prayer, this is agreeable
to Christ’s practice; for, he <i>took bread and blessed it</i>, or prayed
for a blessing on it; and as the apostle expresses it; this
was accompanied with thanksgiving, as he says; <i>When he had
given thanks he brake it</i>, Matt. xxvi. 26. 1 Cor. xi. 24. which
is agreeable to the nature and design of the ordinance, as herein
we pray for the best of blessings, and express our thankfulness
to him for the benefits of Christ’s redemption.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here I cannot but observe how the Papists pervert this ordinance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>in the manner of consecrating the bread, which the
priest does only by repeating these words in Latin; <i>This is my
body</i>; and from thence they take occasion to advance the absurd
doctrine of transubstantiation; and suppose, that, by these
words pronounced, the bread is changed into the body and
blood of Christ; which they assert, contrary to all sense and
reason, as well as the end and design of the ordinance; and
from hence it will follow, that man has a power to make the
body and blood of Christ; and another consequence thereof,
will be, that the human nature of Christ is omnipresent, which
is inconsistent with a finite nature, and those properties that
belong to it as such; from whence it is to be concluded, that
it is no where else but in heaven; and it involves in it the greatest
contradiction to suppose that it is bread, and having all the
qualities thereof; and yet our senses must be so far imposed
on, as that we must believe that it is not so, but Christ’s body.
It also supposes, that Christ has as many bodies as there are
wafers in the world; which is a monstrous absurdity. It likewise
confounds the sign with the thing signified, and is very
opposite to the sense of those words of scripture, <i>This is my
body</i>; which implies no more, than that the bread, which is
the same in itself, after the words of consecration, as it was before,
is an external symbol of Christ’s body, that is, of the sufferings
which he endured therein for his people.</p>

<p class='c006'>V. We are now to consider the actions both of the minister
and the church, when engaged in this ordinance, <i>viz.</i> breaking,
distributing, eating the bread, pouring forth, and drinking the
wine, for the ends appointed by Christ, in instituting this ordinance.
Whether our Saviour gave the bread and wine to
every one of the disciples in particular, is not sufficiently determined
by the words of institution: For, though Matthew
and Mark say, <i>He gave the bread and the cup to the disciples</i>,
Matt. xxvi. 26, 27. and Mark xiv. 22, 23. Yet Luke speaking
either concerning the cup used in the passover, or that in
the Lord’s supper, represents our Saviour as saying to his disciples,
<i>Take this and divide it among yourselves</i>, Luke xxii. 17.
which seems to intimate that he distributed it to one or more
of them, to be conveyed to the rest, that they might divide it
among themselves; which is agreeable to the practice of several
of the reformed churches in our day, and seems most
expedient in case the number of the communicants is very
great, and the elements cannot be so conveniently given by the
pastor into the hand of every one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here I may observe how the Papists pervert this part of the
Lord’s supper; inasmuch as they will not permit the common
people to touch the bread with their hands, lest they should
defile it; but the priest puts it into their mouths; for which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>purpose it is made up into small, round wafers; and the people
are ordered to take great care that they do not use their
teeth in chewing it; for that would be, as it were, a crucifying
Christ afresh, as offering a kind of violence to what they call
his body. But these things are so very absurd and unscriptural,
that they confute themselves. And their consecrating a
wafer to be reserved in a case prepared for that purpose, and
set upon the altar in the church, to be worshipped by all that
come near it, savours of gross superstition and idolatry.</p>

<p class='c006'>We may farther observe, that they deny the people the cup
in this ordinance, but not the priests; for what reason, it is
hard to determine. And, they mix the wine with water;
which, though it does not seem to be agreeable to Christ’s institution,
yet it was often practised by the ancient church, from
whence they took it; and their making this a sacramental sign
of Christ’s divine and human nature, united together in one
person, is much more unwarrantable; nor can I approve of
what others suppose, viz. that it signifies the blood and water
that came out of his side when he was pierced on the cross.
And, I can hardly think some Protestants altogether free from
the charge of superstition, when they so tenaciously adhere to
the use of red wine, as bearing some small resemblance to the
colour of Christ’s blood; for which reason others chuse to bear
their testimony against this ungrounded opinion, by the using
of white wine, without supposing that any thing is signified by
it more than by red; and others chuse to use one sort at one
time, and another at another, to signify that this is an indifferent
matter; and these, I think, are most in the right.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, the practice of the Papists, and some others, in
receiving the Lord’s supper fasting, to the end that the consecrated
bread may not be mixed with undigested food, is not
only unwarrantable, but superstitious, as well as contrary to
what we read concerning our Saviour and his apostles partaking
of the Lord’s supper in the first institution thereof, immediately
after having eaten the passover, and to what the apostle
suggests, when he reproves the church at Corinth, for
eating and drinking to excess immediately before they partook
of the Lord’s supper; upon which occasion he advises them
<i>to eat and drink</i> (though with moderation) <i>in their own houses</i>,
1 Cor. xi. 21, 22.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, the administring the Lord’s supper privately, as the
Papists and others do, to sick people, seems to be contrary to
the design of its being a church-ordinance; and when, to give
countenance to this practice, it is styled, as by the former of
these, a viaticum, or means to convey the soul, if it should
soon after depart out of the body, to heaven, they are much
more remote from our Saviour’s design in instituting this ordinance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>neither do they rightly understand the sense of the
scripture, from whence they infer the necessity thereof, <i>except
ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have
no life in you</i>, John vi. 53. when they apply it to this purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another thing that must not be wholly passed over,
viz. the various gestures used in receiving the Lord’s supper.
The Papists not only receive it kneeling; but, they allege, that
they ought to do so, as being obliged to adore the body and
blood of Christ, which, as they absurdly suppose, is really present,
inasmuch as the bread is transubstantiated, or turned into
it. And the Lutherans, with equal absurdity assert, that
the body of Christ, is really, though invisibly, present in the
bread; which is what they call consubstantiation. Some other
Protestants, indeed, plead for the receiving it kneeling, as supposing
Christ to be spiritually, though not corporally, present
therein; and therefore they do not worship the bread and wine,
but our Saviour; which, they suppose, they ought to do with
this becoming reverence.</p>

<p class='c006'>What I would take leave to say, in answer to this, is, that
we humbly hope and trust, that Christ, according to his promise,
is present with his people in all his ordinances; yet, it is
not supposed that we are obliged to engage in every one of
them kneeling. But that which determines the faith and practice
of all other reformed churches, who do not use this gesture
in the Lord’s supper, is, because it is contrary to the example
of our Saviour and his apostles, when it was first celebrated;
which ought to be a rule to the churches in all succeeding ages.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be said, that this is a gesture most agreeable to prayer,
or, at least, that sitting is not so. To this it may be replied,
that it is not an ordinance principally or only designed for prayer;
for, whatever prayers we put up to God therein, are short,
ejaculatory, and mixed with other meditations, which may be
performed with an awful reverence of the divine majesty, such
as we ought to have in other acts of religious worship, though
we do not use that gesture of kneeling. And besides, we think
ourselves obliged to receive the Lord’s supper sitting, that being
a table gesture in use among us, in like manner as that
which our Saviour and his apostles used, was among the eastern
nations.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the reformed Gallican churches, they receive it for
the most part, standing; which, being a medium between both
extremes, they suppose to be most eligible. But this not being
a table-gesture, nor, in that respect, conformed to that
which was used by our Saviour and his apostles, I cannot think
it warrantable. Nevertheless, when the gesture of standing or
sitting is made a significant sign as some do the former, of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>being servants, ready to obey the will of Christ our great Lord
and Master; or, as others explain it, as signifying our being
travellers to the heavenly country; and the latter, <i>viz.</i> sitting,
of our familiarity, or communion with Christ. These are rather
the result of human invention, than founded on a divine
institution, since we have not the least account in scripture, of
these things being signified thereby. This leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>VI. The thing signified in this ordinance, and in what respect
Christ is said to be present therein, together with the
benefits expected from him, as we are said to feed upon him
by faith for our spiritual nourishment and growth in grace.
I cannot but think that the general design hereof, is not much
unlike to that which was ordained under the ceremonial law,
in which, after the sacrifice was offered, part of it was reserved
to be <i>eaten in the holy place</i>, Lev. vi. 16. which was a significant
feast upon a sacrifice. In like manner, the Lord’s supper,
which comes in the room of the passover, is ordained to
be a feast on Christ’s sacrifice; so the apostle styles it, when
he says, <i>Christ, our passover, is sacrificed for us: Therefore let
us keep the feast</i>, &amp;c. 1 Cor. v. 7, 8. The fiducial application
of Christ, and the benefits of his death, is the principal thing
to be considered in this gospel-festival. However, there are
some cautions necessary to be observed with respect to the
things signified therein, as what may be useful to us that our
faith may be exercised in a right manner. Therefore let it be
considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That though the Lord’s supper was instituted in commemoration
of Christ’s love, expressed in his death, which
was the last and most bitter part of his sufferings for our redemption.
Yet he did not design hereby to exclude his other
sufferings in life; nor, indeed, his whole course of obedience
from his incarnation to his death; since it is very evident that
the death of Christ is often considered in scripture, by a synecdoche,
as denoting the whole course of obedience, both active
and passive, which is the matter of our justification; and therefore
is to be the object on which our faith is to be conversant
in the Lord’s supper, as well as his sufferings in, or immediately
before his death.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. When Christ’s sufferings upon the cross are said to be
signified by the bread and wine; we are not to conclude that
these sufferings are to be so distinctly or separately considered,
as that the bread broken, is designed to signify the pains
that he endured upon the cross, when his body was as it were
broken, its tendons, nerves, and fibres snapped asunder, and
his joints dislocated, by being stretched thereon; and the wine
poured forth, to signify the shedding his blood when his hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>and feet were pierced with the nails, and his side with the
spear, as some suppose; since all these things are to be made
the subjects of our affectionate meditation in every part of this
ordinance, while we are taken up with the contemplation of his
last sufferings. And this seems to give countenance to the
practice of many of the reformed churches, in consecrating and
distributing the bread and wine together; though it is true,
many think, on the other hand, that the elements are to be separately
consecrated, as well as distributed, it being most agreeable
to what is said concerning Christ’s blessing the bread,
and giving it to his disciples, and afterwards taking the cup,
and giving it to them, Matt. xxvi. 26, 27. However, if this be
allowed of, it is not necessary for us to infer from hence, that
each of these elements are designed to signify some distinct
parts of Christ’s sufferings on the cross, but only that the ordinance
is to be still continued, the whole including in it two external
and visible signs to be used, each of which signify the
means whereby he procured our redemption; and, indeed,
when the wine is poured forth, and set apart for another part
of this ordinance, we are not so much to enter on a new subject
in our meditation, though the sign be different from that
of the bread, as to proceed in thinking on, and improving the
love of Christ, in his <i>humbling himself, and becoming obedient
unto death, even the death of the cross</i>, Phil. ii. 8. and all this
is signified by this sign, as well as the other, neither of which
are adapted to this end, otherwise than by divine appointment.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We must take heed that we do not make more significant
signs in the bread and wine than Christ has done; as some
suppose, that almost every ingredient or action used in making
them, is to be applied to signify some things that he has done
or suffered for our redemption. It is a very great liberty that
some take in expatiating on this subject, and applying it to this
ordinance. We have a specimen hereof contained in an hymn,
composed to be sung as a thanksgiving after the receiving the
Lord’s supper<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a>; in which the corn, as first living and growing,
and afterwards cut down, and by threshing, separated
from the husk, and then ground in the mill, and baked in the
oven, are all made significant signs of the sufferings and torments
which our Saviour endured. And the corn being united
in one loaf, is made a sign of the union between Christ and
his church. In like manner the grapes being gathered, pressed,
and made into wine, is supposed to signify our spiritual
joy, arising from Christ’s shedding his blood. And, as many
grapes make one vine, so believers should be united by faith
and love. What lengths is it possible for the wit and fancy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>men to run, when they have a fruitful invention, and are disposed
to make significant signs, and apply them to this ordinance
without a divine warrant!</p>

<p class='c006'>4. When we meditate on Christ’s sufferings, our faith is not
to rest in, or principally be fixed on the grievousness of them,
as Dr. Goodwin observes<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c012'><sup>[99]</sup></a>; so that we should only endeavour
hereby to have our hearts moved to a relenting, and compassion
expressed towards him, and indignation against the
Jews that crucified him, together with an admiring of his noble
and heroical love herein; so that if persons can get their
hearts thus affected, they judge and account this to be grace;
whereas, it is no more than what the like tragical story of some
great and noble personage (full of heroical virtues and ingenuity;
yet inhumanly and ungratefully used) doth ordinarily work
in ingenuous spirits, who read or hear of it; which, when it
reacheth no higher, it is so far from being faith, that it is but
a carnal and fleshly devotion; and Christ himself, at his suffering,
found fault with, as not being spiritual, when he says,
<i>Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me, but for yourselves
and for your children</i>, Luke xxiii. 28. that is, not so much for
this, when you see me thus unworthily handled by those for
whom I die, as for yourselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, he farther adds, that it was not the malice of the
Jews, the falseness of Judas, the fearfulness of Pilate, the iniquity
of the times he fell into, that wrought our Saviour’s
death; God the Father had an higher design herein: And this
our faith is constantly to be conversant about, considering it
as the result of an eternal agreement between the Father and
the Son, and of that covenant which he came into the world
to fulfil; and his being made sin for us, to take away our sins
by the atonement which he made hereby. And, besides this,
we may add, that the highest and most affecting consideration
in Christ’s sufferings, ought to contain in it the idea of his being
a divine person, which is the only thing that argued them
sufficient to answer the great ends designed thereby, as it rendered
them of infinite value; and it was upon this account that
his condescension expressed herein, might truly be said to be
infinite. These things, I say, we are principally to rest in,
when we meditate on Christ’s sufferings in this ordinance;
though the other, which are exceedingly moving and affecting
in their kind, are not to be passed over; since the Holy Ghost
has, for this end, given a particular account thereof in the gospels,
not barely as an historical relation of what was done
to him, but as a convincing evidence of the greatness of his
love to us.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Thus concerning Christ’s death, shewed forth or signified in
this ordinance. We are farther, under this head, to consider
how he is present, and they who engage in it aright feed on his
body and blood by faith. We are not to suppose that Christ
is present in a corporal way, so that we should be said to partake
of his body in a literal sense; but he being a divine person,
and consequently omnipresent; and having promised his presence
with his church in all ages, and places, when met together
in his name; in this respect he is present with them, in
like manner as he is in other ordinances, to supply their wants,
hear their prayers, and strengthen them against corruption and
temptation, and remove their guilt by the application of his
blood, which is presented as an object for their contemplation
in a more peculiar manner in this ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for our feeding on, or being nourished by the body and
blood of Christ, these are metaphorical expressions, taken from,
and adapted to the nature and quality of the bread and wine
by which it is signified; but that which we are to understand
hereby, is, our graces being farther strengthened and established,
and we enabled to exercise them with greater vigour and
delight; and this derived from Christ, and particularly founded
on his death. And, when we are said to feed upon him, in
order hereunto, it denotes the application of what he has done
and suffered, to ourselves; and, in order hereunto, we are to
bring our sins, with all the guilt that attends them, as it were,
to the foot of the cross of Christ, confess and humble our souls
for them before him, and by faith plead the virtue of his death,
in order to our obtaining forgiveness, and, at the same time,
renew our dedication to him, while hoping and praying for the
blessings and privileges of the covenant of grace, which were
purchased by him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, there is another thing signified in this ordinance,
as a farther end for which it was instituted, namely, in that we
are to have communion with one another, and thereby express
our mutual love, as members of Christ’s mystical body, who
have the same end in view, and make use of the same means,
<i>viz.</i> Christ crucified, as we attend on the same ordinance in
which this is set forth, and having the same common necessities,
infirmities and corruptions, and the same encouragements
for our faith. Therefore we ought to sympathize with one
another, and, by faith and prayer, be helpful to them, with
whom we join in this ordinance, while we are representing
our own case in common with theirs, before the Lord. This
leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>VII. What ought to be the qualifications of those who have
a right to, and are obliged to partake of the Lord’s supper:
These are expressed in general terms by the apostle, by <i>discerning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>the Lord’s body</i>, 1 Cor. xi. 29. Now this a person
cannot do, who is ignorant of the design of his death; therefore
there must be some degree of knowledge in those who are
qualified for this ordinance. There must also be an afflictive
sense of the weight and burden of the guilt of those sins which
are daily committed by us, and an apprehension arising from
thence, of our need of the merits of Christ, to take them away,
and that his death is designed to answer this end. And, that
this may be done for our real advantage, as we are said to feed
on Christ by faith; it is supposed, that this grace is wrought in
us, or, that we are effectually called out of a state of unregeneracy,
to partake of gracious communion with Christ; whereby
we may be said to be fitted to have fellowship with him in
this ordinance, and so partake of it in a right manner, for our
spiritual nourishment and growth in grace.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXXI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXI.</span> <i>How are they that receive the sacrament of
the Lord’s supper, to prepare themselves before they come
unto it?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> They that receive the sacrament of the Lord’s supper,
are, before they come, to prepare themselves thereunto, by
examining themselves, of their being in Christ, of their sins,
and wants, of the truth and measure of their knowledge,
faith, repentance, love to God and the brethren, charity to
all men, forgiving those that have done them wrong, of
their desires after Christ, and of their new obedience; and
by renewing the exercise of these graces, by serious meditation,
and fervent prayer.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord’s supper being a sacred and solemn ordinance,
it ought not to be engaged in without due preparation
before-hand, in those who partake of it. The duties mentioned
in this answer, which are preparatory for it, are self-examination,
the renewing the exercise of those graces which
are necessary to our partaking of it aright, serious meditation
on the work we are going about, and fervent prayer for the
presence and blessing of God therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Concerning the duty of self-examination; in order hereunto,
we must retire from the hurries and incumbrances of the
world, that our minds may be disengaged from them, and not
filled with distracting thoughts, which will be an hindrance to
us in our enquiries into the state of our souls. We must also
resolve to deal impartially with ourselves, and consider what
really makes against us, as matter of sorrow, shame, and humiliation,
as well as those things that are encouraging, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>occasions of thanksgiving to God. We must also endeavour
to be acquainted with the word of God, to which our actions
and behaviour are to be applied; whereby we are to determine
the goodness or badness of our state in general, or the frame
of spirit in which we are, in particular.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now there are several things, concerning which we are to
examine ourselves before we come to the Lord’s supper.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Whether we are in Christ or no? since persons must be
first in him before they can have spiritual communion with
him. There are some things, which, if we find in ourselves,
would give us ground to determine that we are not in Christ;
particularly,</p>

<p class='c006'>That man is not in Christ who is an utter stranger to his
person, natures, offices, and the design of his coming into the
world; together with the spiritual benefits purchased by his
death. Neither is he in Christ, who never saw his need of
him, or that there is no hope of salvation without him. Again,
he is not in Christ, who obstinately refuses to submit to his
government, lives in a wilful contempt of his laws, resolutely
persists in the commission of known sins, or in the total neglect
of known duties. Again, he is not in Christ, who is
ashamed of his doctrine, his gospel, his cross, which a true
believer counts his glory; as the apostle says, <i>God forbid that
I should glory, save in the cross of Jesus Christ</i>, Gal. vi. 14.
He must also be reckoned out of Christ, who is stupid and
presumptuous; and, though, probably, he may hope to be saved
by him, yet desires not to have communion with him, but expects
to be made partaker of his benefits without faith; or if
he pretends to have faith, it is only an assent to some truths,
without being accompanied with repentance, and other graces
which are inseparably connected with that faith which is
saving.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, on the other hand, we may know that we are in Christ,
if we can truly say,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That we have received a new nature from him, from
whence proceed renewed actions, which discover themselves in
the whole course of our lives; <i>If any man be in Christ, he is a
new creature: Old things are passed away, behold, all things
are become new</i>, 2 Cor. v. 17.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We must enquire, whether we endeavour constantly to
adhere to his revealed will, not barely as the result of some
sudden conviction; but as making it the main business of life,
to approve ourselves to him in well doing, as our Saviour says,
<i>If ye continue in my word, then ye are my disciples indeed</i>,
John viii. 31.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Converse with Christ in ordinance, is another evidence
of our being in him: For, as a man is said to be known by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>company he keeps, or delights to be in; so a true Christian is
known, as the apostle says, by his <i>having fellowship with the
Father, and with his son Jesus Christ</i>, 1 John i. 3.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) We must enquire, whether we have a great concern for
the glory and interest in our own souls, and an earnest desire
that his name may be known and magnified in the world; and
this accompanied with our using the utmost endeavours in
our various stations and capacities in order thereunto?</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The next thing that we are to examine ourselves about,
before we come to the Lord’s supper, is, what sense we have
of sin? whether we are truly humbled for, and desirous to be
delivered from it? It is not sufficient for us to take a general
view of ourselves as sinners, in common with the rest of mankind,
without being duly affected with it; but we must consider
the various aggravations of sin, with a particular application
thereof to ourselves; and how much we have exceeded many
others therein, either before or since we were called by the
grace of God, by which means we may take occasion to say,
as the apostle does concerning himself, that we are <i>the chief of
sinners</i>, 1 Tim. i. 15. and a sense of the guilt hereof, when
duly considered, will give us occasion to lie very low at the
foot of God. We are also to take notice of our natural propensity
and inclination to sin, and the various ways by which
this has discovered itself in our actions; and accordingly we
are to enquire,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Whether we have sinned knowingly, wilfully, presumptuously,
and obstinately? or, whether we have been surprised
into it, or ensnared by some sudden unforeseen temptation,
and committed it without the full bent of our wills? whether
we have striven against it, or given way to it, and suffered ourselves
to be prevailed upon without making resistance?</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We must enquire, whether we have continued in sin,
or unfeignedly repented of it? whether sin sits light or heavy
on our consciences? or, if our consciences are burdened with
it, whether we seek relief against it in that way which Christ
has prescribed in the gospel?</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) We must enquire, whether there are not some sins that
more frequently and easily beset us? what they are, and whether
we are daily watchful against them, and use our utmost
endeavours to avoid them?</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) We must also enquire, whether we have not frequently
relapsed into the same sin which we have resolved against at
various times, and, in particular, at the Lord’s table, and hereby
broke our engagements; and if so, whether we did not rely
too much on our own strength, when we made those resolutions
against sin?</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) We are to enquire, whether sin gets ground upon us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>whereby grace is weakened? or, whether, though we commit
it, we find its strength abated, and we enabled, in some measure,
to mortify it, though we do not wholly abstain from it? as
the apostle says, <i>That which I do, I allow not; but what I hate,
that do I</i>, Rom. vii. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) We are also to enquire, whether our sins have not carried
in them a great neglect of Christ, his blood, his grace, his
benefits, as not thinking of them, admiring or prizing them
above all things, nor laying hold on them by faith, and so not
making a right use of his dying love, which is signified in the
Lord’s supper.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We are to examine ourselves, before we come to the
Lord’s table, what particular wants we have to be supplied.
Our Saviour is to be considered in this ordinance, not only as
signified by the external elements; but as present with his
people when met together in his name, with earnest expectation
of enjoying communion with him: And, as he is appointed
to apply, as well as purchase redemption for us, we must consider
him as having his hands full of spiritual blessings, to impart
to his necessitous people, who come to him for them:
Therefore they ought before they go, to enquire, not only, as
has been before observed, what are their sins which are to be
confessed and bewailed before him, but what it is more especially,
that they stand in need of from him? The question that
Christ will ask them, when they come there, is, what is thy
petition, and what is thy request? what are those wants which
thou desirest a supply of? Accordingly, we are before-hand
to enquire, whether, though we have some little hope that we
have experienced the grace of God in truth, yet we do not want
a full assurance of our interest in Christ, <i>that we may know
that we have eternal life</i>, 1 John v. 13. together with the joy
of faith accompanying the actings thereof? and, whether we
do not want enlargement of heart, and raised affections in holy
duties? which the Psalmist seems to intend, when he says,
<i>Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name</i>, Psal.
cxlii. 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, whether we do not want many experiences, which
we have formerly had, of the grace of God, and his special
presence in holy duties; or have not occasion to say with Job,
<i>O that it were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved
me: When his candle shined upon my head, and, by his
light I walked through darkness</i>, Job xxix. 2, 3. Moreover,
we are to enquire, whether we do not want a greater degree of
establishment in the great doctrines of the gospel; or to be
kept steady in a time of temptation? and, whether we do not
want a greater degree of zeal for the honour of God, in a day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>in which many professors are lukewarm? as our Saviour observes
concerning the church of Laodicea, <i>That they were
neither cold nor hot</i>, Rev. iii. 15. or, whether we do not want
together with this zeal, a compassion to the souls of others,
who make shipwreck of faith, not having a good conscience,
which may induce us, as the apostle says, <i>In meekness to instruct
those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will
give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth?</i> 2 Tim.
ii. 25. and, whether we are duly affected with the degeneracy
of the age wherein we live, and are not too negligent in bearing
our testimony against the errors advanced therein? or,
whether we understand the meaning of those various dispensations
of providence, which we are under, and what is our
present duty in compliance therewith? These things are of a
more general nature, and to be made the subject of our enquiry,
whenever we draw nigh to Christ in any ordinance in which
we hope for a supply of our wants.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there are other things which we ought to have a more
particular regard to in our enquiries, when we are to engage
in the ordinance of the Lord’s supper.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) In order to our partaking of it aright, we are to enquire,
whether we do not want a clear and distinct apprehension of
the covenant of grace, and the seals thereof, and how we are
to act faith in a way of self-dedication, and how we ought to
renew our covenant engagements with God, which we are
more especially called to do therein?</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Whether we do not want a broken heart, suitably affected
with the dying love of Jesus Christ, which is signified
therein, that we may <i>look on him who was pierced, and mourn</i>,
Zech. xii. 10.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Whether we do not want to be led into the true way
of improving Christ crucified, to answer all those accusations
that are brought in against us, either by Satan or our own consciences,
and how this is an expedient for the taking away the
guilt and power of sin?</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) Whether we do not want to be made more like to
Christ, and conformed to his death, that, while we behold him
represented as dying for us, we may <i>reckon ourselves as dead to
sin</i>, and to the world; and <i>that our old man is crucified with
him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we
should not serve sin</i>? Rom. vi. 6. 10.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) Whether we do not want an abiding impression of the
love of Christ, and a greater stedfastness in our resolution, to
adhere to him; that so, whatever grace we may be enabled to
act, by strength derived from him, may be maintained and exercised,
not only at that time, but when we are more immediately
engaged in that ordinance?</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>These things we are to examine ourselves concerning, that
we may spread our wants before the Lord at his table. And
to induce us hereunto, we may consider, that our corrupt nature
is very prone to think ourselves better than we really are;
so that, how indigent and distressed soever we may be, we are
ready to conclude, with the church of the Laodiceans, that <i>we
are rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing</i>,
Rev. iii. 17.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, if we are not truly sensible of our necessities,
we shall not value Christ’s fulness, or the rich provisions he
has made for his people, and is pleased to dispense in this ordinance;
as it is said, <i>The whole need not a physician, but they
that are sick</i>, Matt. ix. 12. and we must consider, that a great
part of our work therein, consists in ejaculatory prayer, which
we shall not be able to put up in a right manner, if we are not
sensible of our wants; and one reason why we are so often at
a loss in prayer, or go out of the presence of God empty, is,
because our hearts are not enlarged therein, which they cannot
be, unless we are affected with a sense of our necessities.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, to encourage us to examine ourselves concerning them,
before we partake of the Lord’s supper, let us consider that
Christ invites us to draw nigh to him therein; that he may
take occasion to communicate the blessings of his redemption,
which are signified thereby; that he may supply our wants, satisfy
our desires, surmount our difficulties, and apply to us the
great and precious promises of the covenant of grace, which
are to be sought for at his hands, by faith and prayer, which
supposes the performance of this duty of self-examination, with
respect to the blessings that we stand in need of from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. We are, before we partake of the Lord’s supper, to examine
ourselves concerning the truth and measure of our knowledge
in divine things; inasmuch as without the knowledge
hereof, the heart cannot be good, nor any spiritual duty engaged
in, in a right manner. As for a perfect comprehensive
knowledge of divine truths, that is not to be expected, by reason
of the weakness of our capacities, and the imperfection of
this present state; wherein, as the apostle says, <i>we see</i> but
<i>through a glass darkly</i>, or, as it is said elsewhere, <i>We are but
of yesterday, and know</i>, comparatively, <i>nothing</i>, Job viii. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, there is a degree of knowledge, which is not only
attainable, but necessary to our right engaging in this ordinance;
and this does not consist barely in our knowing that
there is a God, or that he is to be worshipped, or that there
was such a person as our Saviour, who lived in the world, was
crucified, rose again from the dead, ascended into heaven, and
shall come again to judge the quick and the dead: For a person
may have a general notion of all these things, and yet be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>unacquainted with the end and design of Christ’s death, and
the blessings and privileges of the covenant of grace, which
he procured thereby, or with the claim that a person may lay
by faith, to them; without which, there is not a sufficient
knowledge, such as the apostle calls <i>a discerning the Lord’s
body</i>, 1 Cor. xi. 29. which we ought to do in this ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, that knowledge of divine truths, which ought not
only to be pressed after, but, we are to examine ourselves,
whether we have, in some measure attained to, respects,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) The person of Christ, as God-man, Mediator, and the
offices which he executes as such; and more particularly, the
manner and end of his executing his priestly office, in which
he offered himself as a sacrifice for sin, which we are more
especially to commemorate in this ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We must have an affecting sense or knowledge of the
guilt of sin; and, as a relief against it, must be acquainted
with the doctrine of the free grace of God, displayed in the
gospel, and founded in the blood of Jesus, whereby sin is
pardoned. We are also to be fully convinced of the almighty
power of the Holy Ghost, whereby alone it can be subdued,
and of the method he takes therein to make the redemption
purchased by Christ, effectual to answer that end.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) We are to endeavour, in some measure, to know God
as our Father, and covenant-God in Christ, who bestows on
his people the rich and splendid entertainment of his house,
and satisfies them with the abundance of his goodness, pursuant
to what Christ has purchased. And we must also know
what it is to deal with him as those who see themselves obliged
herein to devote themselves to him as their God; and what
large expectations they may have from him, whom he has
avouched to be his peculiar people; and how this is a foundation
of that humble boldness with which they are encouraged
to come <i>unto the throne of grace, that they may obtain mercy,
and find grace to help in time of need</i>, Heb. iv. 16.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we are not only to enquire, whether we are apprehensive
of the excellency, glory, and suitableness of those
great things, that are revealed in the gospel, to answer our
particular exigencies, and render us happy in the enjoyment of
God; but whether the knowledge hereof makes a due impression
on our hearts, is of a transforming nature, and has a tendency
to regulate the conduct of our lives, and put us on the
application of these great things to ourselves?</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the degree of our knowledge we must enquire, whether
it be only a single apprehension that the doctrines of the
gospel are true, or, at most, contains in it some general ideas
of their being excellent and worthy of the highest esteem; but
whether we can prove them to be true, and render a reason of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>our faith, without which, it may, indeed, be rightly placed as
to its object? But it cannot be said to be deeply rooted; and
therefore it is exposed to greater danger of being foiled,
weakened, or overthrown by temptation. We must also enquire,
whether we grow in knowledge in proportion to those
opportunities or means of grace that we are favoured with,
which the apostle calls <i>growing in grace, and in the knowledge
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</i>, 2 Pet. iii. 18.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. We are to examine ourselves concerning the truth and
degree of our faith, and other graces that are inseparably connected
with it. As for faith, we are to enquire, whether it
be a living, or what the apostle calls a <i>dead faith</i>, James ii.
17, 18. as being alone, and destitute of those good works
which ought to proceed from it? Whether it only contains in
it an assent to the truth of divine revelation; or, whether it
puts us upon a closure with Christ, embracing him in all his
offices, and trusting in him for all those benefits which he has
purchased by his blood? We must also enquire, what fruits or
effects it produces, and what other graces accompany or flow
from it? Whether it inclines us to set the highest value on
Christ, as being in our esteem, altogether lovely; and gives
us low thoughts of ourselves, as having nothing but what we
depend on him for, or derive from him? Whether it be attended
with some degree of holiness in heart and life, as the
apostle speaks of the <i>heart’s being purified by faith</i>, Acts xv.
9. Again, whether it be such a faith as <i>overcomes the world</i>,
1 John v. 14. and prevents our being easily turned aside from
God, by the snares that we may meet with in it? Whether we
are inclined hereby, to confess ourselves to be <i>strangers and
pilgrims on the earth</i>, Heb. xi. 13. and <i>desire a better country</i>,
ver. 16.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are many other fruits and effects of faith, which the
apostle mentions in Heb. xi. by which we may examine ourselves
concerning the truth and sincerity of this grace; and
there are several graces mentioned in this answer, which are
connected with faith, concerning which, we must enquire, whether
they are found in us, particularly repentance, which must
of necessity be exercised in this ordinance as well as faith;
inasmuch as by the one, we behold Christ’s glory, and, by the
other, we take a view of sins deformity? And it is such a repentance,
as inclines us not only to hate sin, but forsake and
turn from it, as seeing the detestable and odious nature of it,
in what Christ endured to make satisfaction for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>But since faith and repentance have been particularly considered
under a foregoing answer, together with the nature, properties,
and effects thereof<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c012'><sup>[100]</sup></a>; we shall pass them over, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>consider the graces of love to God, desire after Christ, and
our using endeavours to approve ourselves his servants and
subjects, by constant acts of obedience to him: These things
are to be the subject-matter of our enquiry, before we engage
in this ordinance. It is very suitable to the occasion, to enquire,
whether we love Christ or no; inasmuch as we are to
behold and be affected with the most amazing instance of love,
which he has expressed to us; Let us therefore enquire, whether
our love to him be superlative, far exceeding that which
we bear to all creatures, how valuable soever they may be to
us, how nearly soever we may be related to them, or whatever
engagements we may be laid under to esteem and value
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>We may also try the sincerity of our love to God, by enquiring,
whether it puts us on performing the most difficult duties
for his sake, with the greatest cheerfulness? And, whether
we are hereby encouraged to bear the most afflictive evils with
patience; because it is his pleasure that we should be exercised
therewith, 1 Sam. iii. 18. Let us also enquire, whether
we love him with all our heart, or, whether our love is divided
betwixt him and the creature, whereby our affections are often
drawn aside from him? And, whether it puts us upon improving
our time, strength, and all our other talents to his
glory? Whether we have no interest separate from his, which
we cannot but prefer to our chief joy? whether this be the
very end of living? As the apostle says, <i>For me to live is
Christ</i>, Phil. i. 21. and, whether we are earnestly desirous to
bring others to him, not only by recommending his glory to
them in words; but by expressing the esteem and value we
have for him, in the whole course of our conversation? Whether
we are hereby inclined to hate every thing that he hates;
as the Psalmist says, <i>Ye that love the Lord hate evil</i>, Psal.
xcviii. 10. and whether we make those things the object of our
choice that he delights in?</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we are to enquire, whether we have had any
communion with him in ordinances, and particularly in this
ordinance at other times? And when he is pleased to withhold
this privilege from us in any degree, that hereby we may
see that all our comforts flow from him; or, when he has a
design to humble us for those sins that provoke him to depart
from us, whether we are earnestly desirous of his return, and
cannot be satisfied with any thing short of him?</p>

<p class='c006'>As for our desires after Christ, which we are farther to examine
ourselves about, we must enquire, whether, that, which
moves or inclines us to desire him, be the view we have of the
glory of his person, and the delight that arises from our contemplating
his divine excellencies; or whether we desire him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>only for the sake of his benefits, or, that he might deliver us
from the wrath to come? Whether we desire Christ only when
his service is attended with the esteem of men, or, as a means
to gain some worldly advantage from them? Or, whether we
desire to adhere to him, when we are called to suffer reproach,
or even the loss of all things for his sake; which will be a
convincing evidence of the sincerity of our desires after, and,
consequently, of our love to him?</p>

<p class='c006'>And, we are farther to enquire, whether our love to Christ,
and desire after him, discovers itself by renewed acts of obedience
to him; particularly, whether our obedience be universal
or partial, constant or wavering, performed with delight
and pleasure or with some reluctancy? And, whether it puts
us upon universal holiness, as being induced hereunto by
gospel-motives? Thus concerning our examining ourselves
about our faith, repentance, love to Christ, desire after him,
and our endeavour to yield obedience to him in all things.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next thing we are to examine ourselves concerning, is,
whether we have such a love to the brethren, and charity to
all men, whereby we are disposed to exercise forgiveness to
those that have done us any injuries? The Lord’s-supper being
an ordinance of mutual fellowship, we are obliged to behave
ourselves towards one another as members of the same
body, subjects of the same Lord, engaged in the same religious
exercise; and consequently, are obliged to love one
another, whereby it will appear, that we are Christ’s disciples,
John xiii. 35. This love consists in our desiring and endeavouring
to promote the spiritual interest of each other, to the end
that Christ herein may be glorified; and it includes in it that
charity that casts a veil over their failures and defects, and our
forgiving those injuries which they have, at anytime, done to
us. This frame of spirit is certainly becoming the nature of
the ordinance, in which we hope to be made partakers of the
fruits and effects of Christ’s love, and to obtain forgiveness
from him, of all the injuries we have done against him; therefore
it is very necessary for us to enquire,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] Concerning our love to the brethren, whether it be such
as is a distinguishing character of those who are Christ’s
friends and followers; or which, as the apostle expresses it,
will afford an evidence to us, that we are <i>passed from death to
life</i>, 1 John iii. 14. And, in order to our discovering this, let
us examine ourselves, whether we love the brethren, because
we behold the image of God in them? Which is, in effect, to
love and <i>glorify God in them</i>, Gal. i. 24. Again, whether our
love to men leads us to desire and endeavour to be reckoned a
common good to all, according to the utmost of our ability?
As it is said of Mordecai, that <i>he was accepted of the multitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and
speaking peace to all his seed</i>, Esther x. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, we are to enquire, whether our love be more especially
to the souls of men, as well as their outward concerns?
This consists in our using all suitable endeavours to bring them
under conviction of sin, by faithful and well-timed reproofs;
the contrary to which, or our refusing to rebuke our <i>neighbour
or brother</i>, and thereby <i>suffering sin upon him</i>, is reckoned no
other than an <i>hating</i> of him, Lev. xix. 17. We are also to
express our love to the souls of men, by endeavouring to persuade
them to believe in Christ, if they are in an unconverted
state, or to walk as becomes his gospel, if they have been
made partakers of the grace thereof: Thus the apostle expresses
his love to those to whom he writes, when he says,
<i>I travail in birth again till Christ be formed in you</i>, Gal. iv. 19.
and elsewhere, he signifies to another of the churches, how
<i>affectionately desirous</i> he was <i>of them</i>; which made him <i>willing,
not only to impart the gospel of God, but his own soul;
because they were dear unto him</i>, 1 Thes. ii. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, we must enquire, whether our love puts us upon
choosing such to be our associates that truly fear the Lord;
whom we count, as the Psalmist expresses it, <i>The excellent,
in whom is all our delight</i>? Psal. xvi. 3. and, on the other
hand, whether we avoid the society of, or intimacy with, those
that are Christ’s open enemies; the contrary to which, good
Jehoshaphat was reproved for by the prophet, when he says,
<i>Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the
Lord?</i> 2 Chron. xix. 2. Again, let us enquire, whether our
love to men is then expressed when it is most needed? As it
is said, <i>A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for
adversity</i>, Prov. xvii. 17. Again, whether we are inclined to
all those acts of charity which covereth a multitude of faults?
As the apostle describes it, that it <i>suffereth long, and is kind;
envieth not; vaunteth not itself; is not puffed up; doth not behave
itself unseemly; seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,
thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the
truth: Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
and endureth all things</i>, 1 Cor. xiii. 4,-8.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] We are to enquire, whether our love to men be expressed
in forgiving injuries; which is a frame of spirit absolutely
necessary for our engaging in any ordinance; as our Saviour
says, <i>If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest
that thy brother hath ought against thee</i>, Matt. v. 23, 24. that
is, if there be a misunderstanding between you, whoever be the
aggressor, or gave the first occasion for it, <i>leave there thy gift
before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother</i>;
that is, do whatever is in thy power in order thereunto,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>and <i>then come and offer thy gift</i>. And this is more necessary
when we engage in this ordinance, in which we hope to obtain
forgiveness of the many offences which we have committed against
God; and accordingly the apostle says, <i>Let us keep the
feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and
wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and
truth</i>, 1 Cor. v. 8. It is no difficult matter for us to know whether
we are disposed to forgive those who have injured us;
therefore the principal thing we are to examine ourselves about,
is, whether we do this with a right frame of spirit, as considering
how prone we are to do those things ourselves, which
may render it necessary for us to be forgiven, both by God
and man? and whether, as the consequence hereof, though we
were before this, inclined to over-look those graces which are
discernable in them; yet now we can love them as brethren,
and glorify God for what they have experienced, and be earnestly
solicitous for their salvation as well as our own? Thus
concerning the first duty mentioned in this answer, <i>viz.</i> our
examining ourselves before we engage in this ordinance. We
now proceed to consider some other duties mentioned therein,
<i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>II. The renewing the exercise of those graces, which are
necessary to our right engaging in it, whereby the sincerity
and truth thereof may be discerned: Therefore, since faith,
repentance, and several other graces, ought to be exercised in
this ordinance, it is necessary for us to give a specimen thereof,
before we engage in it. As the artificer first tries the instrument
he is to make use of in some curious work before he uses
it, so the truth and sincerity of our faith is to be tried before
it be exercised in this ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another duty preparatory to the Lord’s Supper,
mentioned in this answer, <i>viz.</i> serious meditation, that so we
may not engage in it without considering the greatness of the
Majesty with whom we have to do, together with our own
vileness and unworthiness to approach his presence: We must
also consider his power, wisdom, and goodness, to encourage
us to hope for those supplies of grace from him, which we
stand in need of; and we are to have an awful sense of his
omnipresence and omniscience, as he is an heart-searching God,
to excite in us an holy reverence, and prevent the wandering
of our thoughts and affections from him, or any unbecoming
behaviour in his presence; and, more particularly we are to
consider, before-hand, the end and design of Christ’s instituting
this ordinance, <i>viz.</i> that his dying love to sinners might
be signified and shewed forth, as an encouragement to our faith,
and an inducement to thanksgiving and praise, as the nature of
the thing calls for it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>After all this it is farther observed, that we are to endeavor
to prepare for this ordinance by fervent prayer, as being
sensible, that when we have done our best, we shall be too
much unprepared for it, unless we have the special assistance
of God, when engaging in it; to which I may apply Hezekiah’s
words, <i>The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his
heart to seek God, the Lord God of his father; though he be
not cleansed according to the cleansing of the sanctuary</i>, 2
Chron. xxx. 18, 19. And we are to be earnest with him, that
he would give us a believing view of Christ crucified, and especially
of our interest in him; that we may be able to say as
the apostle does, <i>He loved me, and gave himself for me</i>, Gal. ii.
20. and that he would apply to us those blessings which he has
purchased by his death, which we desire to wait upon him for,
when engaging in this ordinance, that our drawing nigh to
him therein may redound to his glory and our spiritual advantage.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXXII., CLXXIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXII.</span> <i>May one who doubteth of his being in
Christ, and of his due preparation, come to the Lord’s
Supper?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> One who doubteth of his being in Christ, or of his due
preparation to the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, may
have true interest in Christ, though he be not assured thereof;
and in God’s account, hath it, if he be duly affected
with the apprehension of the want of it, and unfeignedly desires
to be found in Christ, and to depart from iniquity, in
which case (because promises are made, and this sacrament
is appointed for the relief even of weak and doubting Christians,)
he is to bewail his unbelief; and labour to have his
doubts resolved, and so doing, he may, and ought to come
to the Lord’s Supper, that he may be farther strengthened.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXIII.</span> <i>May any who profess the faith, and desire
to come to the Lord’s Supper, be kept from it?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Such as are found to be ignorant, or scandalous, notwithstanding
their profession of the faith, and desire to
come to the Lord’s Supper, may, and ought to be kept from
that sacrament by the power which Christ hath left in his
church, until they receive instruction, and manifest their reformation.</p>

<p class='c011'>In these answers we have an account of those who are the
subjects of this ordinance and ought to partake of it, or of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>those who must be kept from it: the former respects, more especially
doubting Christians, who desire to receive satisfaction,
whether they ought to engage in it or no; the latter respects
those who are ready to presume that they are qualified for it,
and ought to partake of it; though, indeed, they are to be excluded
from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. As to the case of one who doubteth of his being in Christ,
and duly prepared for the Lord’s Supper: Here are several
things that may afford matter of encouragement to him; and
accordingly it is observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That though this be a matter of doubt to him, as being
destitute of assurance of his being in Christ; yet he may be
mistaken in the judgment which he passes concerning himself:
since assurance, as has been before observed, is not of the essence
of saving faith<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c012'><sup>[101]</sup></a>. For a person may rely on, or give up
himself to Christ, by a direct act of faith, who cannot at the
same time, take the comfort that would otherwise arise from
thence, that Christ has loved him, and given himself for him.
Many have reason to complain of the weakness of their faith,
and the great resistance and disturbance which they meet with
from the corruption of nature: And others, who have assurance,
at present, of their interest in Christ, may afterwards,
through divine desertion, lose the comfortable sense thereof;
so that we must not conclude, that every doubting believer is
destitute of faith. Such are to be tenderly dealt with, and not
discouraged from attending on that ordinance, which others,
who converse with them, cannot but think they have a right
to, and are habitually prepared for; though they themselves
very much question, whether they are actually meet for it, as
being apprehensive that they cannot exercise those graces, that
are necessary to their partaking of this ordinance in a right
manner. However, it is observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That there are some things, which, if duly considered
by such an one, would afford him, ground of hope; though it
may be, he cannot sufficiently improve them to his own comfort.
As,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] If he be truly affected with his want of assurance, and,
as the result thereof, is filled with uneasiness in his own mind,
laments his condition, and can take no comfort in any outward
enjoyments, while destitute of it; and, if he be importunate
with God in prayer, that he would lift up the light of his countenance
upon him, and grant him the exercise, as well as the joy
of faith. Moreover, if he frequently examines himself with
impartiality, and an earnest desire to be satisfied, as to his
state; and if, notwithstanding this, he still walks in darkness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>and his doubts and fears prevail against him, he has some
ground to conclude, that he is better than he apprehends himself
to be, if he be truly humbled for those sins that may be
reckoned the procuring cause thereof, and determines to be
still waiting, till God shall be pleased to discover to him
his interest in forgiving grace, and thereby resolve his doubts,
and expel his fears, which render him so very uneasy.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] A person has some ground of hope, if he can say, that
he unfeignedly desires Christ and grace above all things, and
can find satisfaction in nothing short of him; in this respect it
may be said, that Christ is precious to him, as he is to them
that believe. And to this we may add, that if he desires to forsake
all sin, as being offensive, and contrary to him; so that
when he commits it, he can readily say with the apostle, <i>That
which I do I allow not of; for what I would, that do I not; but
what I hate that do I</i>; and from hence he concludes himself
<i>wretched</i>; and earnestly desires to be <i>delivered from the body
of this death</i>, Rom. vii. 15, 24.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) There are some promises which a weak Christian may
lay hold on for his encouragement; as,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, If the guilt of sin lies as an heavy burden upon him,
and is the occasion of his doubts about his being in Christ;
there are promises of forgiveness, Mich. vii. 18, 19. Isa.
lv. 7, 8.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, If he complains of the power of sin, and its prevalency
over him, there is a promise that is suited to his case, in
Rom. vi. 14. ‘Sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye
are not under the law, but under grace.’</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, If satan’s temptations are very grievous to him, and
such as he can hardly resist, there are promises suited to this
case, in 1 Cor. x. 13. that ‘God will not suffer his people to be
tempted above that they are able, but will, with the temptation,
make a way to escape;’ and in Rom. xvi. 20. ‘The
God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.’</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, If he wants enlargement, and raised affections in
prayer, or other religious duties; which is very discouraging
to him, that promise may afford him some relief, in Zech. xii.
10. ‘I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication.’
And, in Psal. x. 17. ‘Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the
humble: Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine
ear to hear.’</p>

<p class='c006'><i>5thly</i> If our doubts arise from frequent backslidings, and
relapses into sin, we may apply that promise in Psal. xxiii. 3.
<i>He restoreth my soul</i>, &amp;c. And, Hos. xiv. 4. ‘I will heal their
backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned
away from them:’ And in Isa. lvii. 17, 18. in which it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>supposed, that God was wroth, and hid himself from his people
for their iniquity; and they are described as <i>going on frowardly
in the way of their heart</i>; yet God says, ‘I have seen
his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore
comforts to him, and to his mourners:’ And, in Hos. xi. 7-9.
where God’s people are described as bent to backslide
from him; yet he determines not to destroy them, but says, in
a very moving way, ‘How shall I give thee up Ephraim?
How shall I deliver thee Israel, <i>&amp;c.</i> Mine heart is turned
within me, my repentings are kindled together? I will not
execute the fierceness of mine anger; I will not return to destroy
Ephraim; for I am God and not man, the holy One in
the midst of thee.’</p>

<p class='c006'><i>6thly</i>, If we want communion with God, or his presence
with us in his ordinances; which makes us conclude that we
are not in Christ: Let us consider what is said in Isa. xlv. 19.
‘I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain:’ And,
in chap. liv. 7, 8. ‘For a small moment have I forsaken thee,
but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I
hid my face from thee, for a moment; but with everlasting
kindness will I have mercy on thee.’</p>

<p class='c006'><i>7thly</i>, If we are under frequent convictions, but they soon
wear off, which occasions us to fear that we never experienced
a thorough work of conversion, let us consider, Isa. lxvi. 9.
‘Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth, saith
the Lord?’ And, in Zech. iv. 10. ‘Who hath despised the
day of small things?’ And, in Isa. lxv. 8. ‘As the new
wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for
a blessing is in it; So will I do for my servants sake, that I
may not destroy them all.’</p>

<p class='c006'><i>8thly</i>, If we are in a withering and declining condition, and
want reviving; or, if we complain of barrenness under the
means of grace, so that we may attend upon them, as we apprehend,
to very little purpose; there are some promises that
are suited to this case, as Hos. xiv. 7, 8. Isa. xlviii. 17.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>9thly</i>, If our doubts arise from the hardness of our hearts,
so that we cannot mourn for sin as we ought to do, or would
do, let us consider what God has promised in Ezek. vii. 16.
Deut. xxx. 6. Acts v. 31.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>10thly</i>, If we are under the visible tokens of God’s displeasure,
so that we are ready to conclude, that he distributes terrors
to us in his anger; and, as the consequence thereof, we
walk in darkness, and are far from peace: There are many
promises that are suited to this case, as Jer. iii. 5. Psal. ciii. 8,-10.
Isa. xii. 1. Joel ii. 13. Isa. l. 10. Psal. lxxix. 15. and
xlii. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We have a further account how such, who are at present,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>discouraged from coming to the Lord’s table, ought to
manage themselves in this case. And here it is observed,
that they ought to bewail their unbelief, to labour to have their
doubts resolved; and, instead of being discouraged, they
should come to the Lord’s supper, to be further strengthened.
This advice is not given to stupid sinners, or such as are unconcerned
about their state, or never had the least ground to
conclude that they have had communion with God in any ordinance;
and, especially if their distress of conscience arises
rather from a slavish fear of the wrath of God, than a filial
fear of him; or, if they are more concerned about the dreadful
consequences of sin, than the intrinsic evil that is in it, I
say, this advice is not given to such, but those, as before described,
who lament after the Lord, earnestly seek him, though
they cannot, at present, find him; and have fervent desires of
his presence, though no sensible enjoyment thereof, and appear
to have some small degrees of grace, though it be very
weak: In this case a few words of advice ought to be given
to them; particularly,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That they should take heed of giving way to any hard
thoughts of God; but, on the other hand, lay the whole blame
hereof on themselves. Thus God says by the prophet, “Hast
thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken
the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way?”
Jer. ii. 17.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) They should give glory to, depend on, and seek relief
from the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, who glorifies himself by
sealing believers unto the day of redemption; and, together
with this, bestows those comforts on them which they stand in
need of.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) They must endeavour, to their utmost, to act grace, and
so go forward in the ways of God, though they do not go on
comfortably, and not say, “why should I wait on the Lord
any longer?” Are they sometimes afraid they shall not arrive
safely to the end of their race, they should nevertheless resolve
not to give out, or to run no longer in it; and because
their way is attended with darkness, or hedged up with thorns,
they should not determine, for that reason, to go backward, as
though they had never set their faces heaven-ward.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) They ought to lie at God’s foot, acknowledging their
unworthiness of that peace which they desire, but are destitute
of, and plead for his special presence, that would give an
happy turn to the frame of their spirits, as that which they
prefer to all the enjoyments of life; as the Psalmist says,
‘There be many that say, Who will shew us any good?
Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us,’
Psal. iv. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>(5.) It would be adviseable for such to contract an intimacy,
and frequently converse with experienced Christians, who
know the depths of Satan, and the deceitfulness of the heart of
man, and the methods of divine grace in restoring comforts to
those who are, at present, destitute of them, agreeably to what
they themselves have experienced in the like case, 2 Cor. i. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) They ought, as a farther means for the strengthening of
their faith, and establishing their comforts, to wait on God in
the ordinance of the Lord’s supper, hoping for Christ’s presence
therein; in which many have found that they have been
enlivened, quickened, and comforted, while others, through the
neglect hereof, have had their doubts and fears increased.
And this leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. What is contained in the latter of the answers we are explaining,
which is applicable to those who desire to come to the
Lord’s supper, but are to be kept from it. Here it is taken for
granted, that all are not to be admitted to this ordinance,
though it may be, they make a general profession of the Christian
faith, and are not willing that any should question their
right to it. These are described in this answer,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As being ignorant of the great doctrines of the gospel,
and, consequently, unacquainted with Christ, whom they never
truly applied themselves to, nor received by faith; and
therefore they cannot improve this ordinance aright, or have
communion with Christ therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. They are to be excluded from the Lord’s supper, who
are scandalous or immoral in their practice, whatever pretensions
they make to the character of Christians: These are
described by the apostle, as persons who <i>profess that they
know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable and
disobedient and unto every good work reprobate</i>, Tit. i. 16.
Such ought not to have communion with those whom the
apostle describes as <i>called to be saints</i>, Rom. i. 7. nor can they
partake of this ordinance aright, since they are not apprized of
the end and design thereof, nor are they able, as the apostle
expresses it, to <i>discern the Lord’s body</i>, 1 Cor. ix. 27. for, if
they are strangers to themselves, how can they apply the benefits
of Christ’s redemption to their own case? and, if they
neglect the preparatory duty of self-examination, so that they
do not know their own wants, how can they go to Christ in
this ordinance for a supply thereof? or, if they do not desire
the spiritual blessings of the covenant of grace, what right can
they have to make use of the seals thereof? and if they are
openly and visibly of another family, under the dominion of
the powers of darkness, what right have they to the privileges
which Christ has purchased for those who are members of his
family, and spiritually united to him?</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span><i>Object.</i> 1. To what has been said concerning those that are
to be excluded from this ordinance, it is objected, that it appears,
that both good and bad have a right to it, from what
our Saviour says in the parable of the wheat and the tares, in
Mat. xiii. 29. both which are said to <i>grow together until the
harvest</i>, when the reapers will be sent to <i>gather first the tares,
and bind them in bundles to burn them, and the wheat into the
barn</i>: So that hypocrites, and sincere Christians, are to continue
together in the same church, and, consequently to partake
of the same ordinances.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied; this is not the sense of
the parable; for our Saviour explains it otherwise, when he
says in ver. 38. <i>The field is the world: the good seed are the
children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the
wicked one.</i> And from hence we may infer, that good and
bad men are, through the forbearance of God, suffered to live
together in the world; but it gives no countenance to this supposition,
that the wicked ought to be joined with the godly as
members of the same church: Not but that hypocrites may,
and often do intrude themselves into the churches of Christ;
yet since this is not known to them, they are not to blame for
it, the heart of man being known to God alone; and the
judgment that we are to pass concerning those who are admitted
into church-fellowship, or to the Lord’s supper in particular,
is to be founded on that credible profession which they
make; in which, though it be possible for them to deceive
others, yet the guilt and ill consequence thereof, will only affect
themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> 2. It is further objected, that Judas was at the
Lord’s supper when it was first instituted by our Saviour,
though he knew him to be an hypocrite and a traitor, and that
he would speedily execute what he had designed against his
life; and if so, then all ought to be admitted to this ordinance.
And the reason that is generally assigned why he
was there at that time, is, because it is said, in Luke xxii. 14.
<i>When the hour was come, he sat down, and his twelve apostles
with him</i>; and afterwards we read, in ver. 19. that <i>he took
bread and brake it</i>, &amp;c. <i>and also the cup after supper</i>, &amp;c. ver.
20. and then it is said, in ver. 21. <i>Behold the hand of him that
betrayeth me is with me on the table</i>. This is supposed, by
some, to have been spoken by Christ when they were eating
the Lord’s supper; from whence it may be concluded that
Judas was there.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> But to this it may be replied; that it seems much
more probable that he was not there when the Lord’s supper
was administered though he joined with Christ and the other
apostles in eating the passover; for we must consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>(1.) That the passover and the Lord’s supper were celebrated,
one immediately after the other, at the same table, or sitting;
therefore the hand of Judas might be with Christ on the table,
in the former, though not in the latter: So that, though these
words, <i>the hand of him that betrayeth me, is with me on the
table</i>, are inserted after the account of both these ordinances
being concluded; yet we have ground to suppose, they were
spoken while they were eating the passover, when Judas was
present.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) It appears yet more probable that he was not present at
the Lord’s supper, from the account which John gives of this
matter, in chap. xiii. 21. wherein our Saviour tells them, that
<i>one of them should betray him</i>: and, in ver. 26. he discovers
that he meant Judas, by giving him the sop; and in ver. 30.
it is said, that <i>having received the sop, he went immediately out</i>.
Now it is certain there was no sop in the Lord’s supper, as
there was in the passover, inasmuch as there was no flesh
therein: Therefore Judas went out when they were eating the
passover, before they began to partake of the Lord’s supper;
being, as we may reasonably suppose, in a rage that his hypocrisy
should be detected, and he marked out as a traitor, who
was, before this, reckoned as good a man as any of them:
Therefore we have not sufficient ground from hence to conclude,
that wicked men ought to be admitted to partake of the
Lord’s supper.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> 3. For Christians to exclude any from the Lord’s
supper, would argue a great deal of pride, or vain-glorious
boasting, and it is, as it were, to say to them who are excluded,
“Stand off, for we are holier than you.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> 1. A believer may with thankfulness, acknowledge
the distinguishing grace of God vouchsafed to him, and not to
others; and, at the same time, bless him, that he has given
him a right to the privilege of his house, which all are not admitted
to partake of, without doing this in a boasting way; he
may say with the apostle in 1 Cor. xv. 10. <i>By the grace of
God I am what I am</i>; and yet at the same time, deal faithfully
with those who are destitute of this grace; he may bless God
for the right which he hopes he has to this ordinance, and yet
it is not his duty to admit them to it who have no right.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It is one thing not to admit persons who are unqualified
to this ordinance, and another thing to despise them upon this
account. Our business is not to reproach them, but to treat
them with meekness; if peradventure God may give them repentance
to the acknowledgment of the truth, that hereby they
may appear to have a right to it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> 4. If wicked men are to be excluded from one ordinance
which Christ has instituted in his church, they may, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the same reason be excluded from all; and so they may as well
be debarred the privilege of hearing the word, and joining
with the church in public prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> There is not the same reason for excluding wicked
men from hearing the word, or joining in prayer with the
church, as there is for refusing to admit them to partake of
the Lord’s supper. For prayer, and preaching the word, are
God’s appointed means for the working the grace of faith, instructing
the ignorant, awakening the stupid and secure sinner,
and putting him on complying with that method of salvation
which God has prescribed in the gospel, and embracing
Christ as offered therein: Whereas, on the other hand, the
Lord’s supper is an ordinance which supposes the soul to have,
before this, received Christ by faith; and therefore he is therein
to feed upon him, and to take comfort from what he has
done and suffered for him, as conducive to the farther mortification
of indwelling sin; which supposes that he has had, before
this, some experience of the grace of God in truth. Thus
concerning the exclusion of ignorant or immoral persons, as
being not qualified for the Lord’s supper.</p>

<p class='c006'>And here we may farther observe, that they who bring
these and such-like objections, with a design to open the door
of the church so wide, that all may be received into it, and
partake of those ordinances by which it is more particularly
distinguished from the world, are very ready, in defence of
their own cause, to charge others with being too severe in
their censures, and refusing to admit any into church-communion,
unless they can tell the very time in which they were
converted, and the means by which this work was begun, and
carried on; and this they are obliged to do in so public a manner,
as that many are denied the privilege of partaking of this
ordinance, for a mere circumstance; which is an extreme as
much to be avoided as the receiving unqualified persons to the
Lord’s supper.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it may be replied to this, that since this charge is rather
the result of surmize than founded on sufficient evidence, it
deserves to have less notice taken of it: However, this I
would say in answer to it, that I never knew it to be the practice
of any church of Christ, to exclude persons from its communion,
because they knew not the time or means of their conversion;
which may be sometimes occasioned by their having
been favored with the blessing of a religious education and restraining
grace from their childhood, so that they have not
run those lengths in sin which others have done; and therefore
the change which is wrought in conversion, especially as
to what concerns the time and manner thereof, is less discernible.
Sometimes the work has been begun with a less degree of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>the terrors of conscience, under a sense of the guilt of sin, and
the condemning sentence of the law, than others have experienced:
These have been drawn with the cords of love, and
the grace of God has descended upon them insensibly, like the
dew upon the grass; and therefore all that can be perceived
by them, or that is to be required of them as a necessary qualification
for their being admitted to the ordinances and privileges
which belong to believers, is their discovering those fruits
of faith which are discernible in the conversation of such as
have experienced the grace of God in truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the other part of the charge, in which some churches
are pretended to insist on such terms of communion as are
merely circumstantial, so as to refuse to receive any that cannot
comply with them: This is to be answered by those who
appear to be liable to it. All that I shall therefore add under
this head, is, that since a visible profession of faith in Christ
is to be made, as necessary to constitute a visible church, and
the conversation of those who make it, ought to be apparently
agreeable thereunto: And inasmuch as none are obliged to
make any thing known to the church, that contains the least appearance
of dishonour or reflection on their character in the
world; but are only required to testify and give a proof of
their steady adherence to Christ, and their desire to embrace
him in all his offices, as well as worship him in all his ordinances;
this cannot justly be reckoned an unnecessary circumstance
or making that a term of communion which Christ has
not made, and thereby excluding those who have a right to
the Lord’s supper.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now we have considered the terms of communion, and
the qualifications for it, as well as the spiritual privileges that
are to be expected by those who have a right to it. I cannot
but observe, how this is abused, and practically disowned, by
those who engage in this ordinance merely as a qualification
for a civil employment. A person may certainly be a good
member of a commonwealth, and very fit to be entrusted with
the administration of the civil affairs thereof, who has little or
nothing to say concerning his experiences of the grace of God.
To assert, that a right to a civil employment is founded on the
same qualifications that give a person a right to partake of the
Lord’s supper, would be to advance, not only that which is
indefensible, but what would be almost universally denied, unless
it could be proved, that all might partake of it, the contrary
to which, we have endeavoured to maintain.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, when Christ instituted this ordinance, his people
were in no expectation of bearing any part in the civil government;
therefore this was most remote from the first intent and
design thereof: And we often find that this is a temptation to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>men to profane this ordinance, and lays a burden on the consciences
of those who know themselves unprepared for it, who
had little or nothing in view but the securing their secular interest;
by which means it is to be feared, that many of them
eat and drink unworthily, and, instead of receiving advantage
by it, bring their consciences under such entanglements, that
they cannot easily extricate themselves from. Thus concerning
those who are to be admitted to be partakers of the Lord’s
Supper, though doubting of their meetness for it, and others
being excluded, who have no right to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last thing observed in this answer, is, that they who
are not, at present, deemed fit for this ordinance, may afterwards
be admitted to it when they have received instruction,
and manifested a thorough reformation; or when, by their diligent
attendance on other ordinances, or means of grace, accompanied
with the divine blessing, that, which at present
disqualifies them, being removed, they may humbly and thankfully
wait on God therein, and hope for his presence and blessing;
and then the church will have reason, as well as themselves,
to bless God for that grace which they have experienced,
whereby they may come to it for the better, and not for
the worse.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXIV.</span> <i>What is required of them that receive the
sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, in the time of the administration
of it?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> It is required of them that receive the sacrament of
the Lord’s Supper, that during the time of the administration
of it, with all holy reverence and attention they wait
upon God in that ordinance, diligently observe the sacramental
elements and actions, heedfully discern the Lord’s
body, and affectionately meditate on his death and sufferings,
and thereby stir up themselves to a vigorous exercise
of their graces, in judging themselves and sorrowing for
sin, in hungering and thirsting after Christ, feeding on him
by faith, receiving of his fulness, trusting in his merits, rejoicing
in his love, giving thanks for his grace, in renewing
of their covenant with God, and love to all the saints.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXV.</span> <i>What is the duty of Christians after they
have received the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><i>Answ.</i> The duty of Christians after they have received the
sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, is, seriously to consider
how they have behaved themselves therein, and with what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>success; if they find quickening and comfort, to bless God
for it, beg the continuance of it, watch against relapses, fulfil
their vows, and encourage themselves to a frequent attendance
on that ordinance; but if they find no present benefit,
more exactly to review their preparation to, and carriage
at the sacrament; in both which, if they can approve
themselves to God and their own consciences, they are to
wait for the fruit of it in due time; but if they see they
have failed in either, they are to be humbled, and to attend
upon it afterward with more care and diligence.</p>

<p class='c011'>These two answers respect our behaviour in, and after
our engaging in this ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. We are to consider with what frame of spirit we are to
engage therein; how our meditations are to be employed, and
what graces are to be exercised.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Here is something observed, which is common to it with
all other ordinances, <i>viz.</i> that we are to wait on God with an
holy reverence arising from a becoming sense of his divine
perfections, and the infinite distance we stand in from him;
and we are to impress on our souls an awful sense of his omniscience
and omnipresence; whereby he knows with what
frame of spirit we draw nigh to him, better than this is known
to ourselves; and highly resents every thing that is contrary to
his holiness, or unbecoming the character of those who are
worshipping at his footstool.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. There are other things peculiar to this ordinance, that
are necessary in order to our engaging in it in a right manner;
as,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) We are diligently to observe the sacramental elements
and actions, which contain the external part of the duty required
of us. The bread and wine, together with the actions
to be performed in our receiving them by Christ’s appointment,
are, as has been before observed, significant and instructive
signs of his death, and the benefits which he has procured
for us thereby, that are to be attended to, and brought to our
remembrance in this ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we are to consider, that though the blessings of
the covenant of grace are signified thereby, as they are instituted,
not natural signs thereof; yet the gospel, in which we
have an account of what Christ did, and suffered for us, is a
large and sufficient explication hereof for the direction of our
faith, when conversant about them.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We are affectionately to meditate on the sufferings and
death of Christ, which are signified thereby. Meditation is
a great part of the work we are to be engaged in, and the
death of Christ is the principal subject thereof; accordingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>we are to consider his condescending love in giving his life a
ransom for us; and, in order to our being affected therewith,
and to excite our admiration and thankfulness for it, we must
contemplate the divine excellency and glory of his Person;
which adds an infinite value to every part of his obedience and
sufferings. We must also consider the kind of death he died;
which is called his being <i>wounded</i>, <i>bruised</i>, Isa. liii. 5. <i>cut off</i>
Dan. ix. 26. and is represented as that which had the external
mark of the curse of God annexed to it; upon which account
he is said to have been made a curse for us, Gal. iii. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are also to consider the character of the persons for
whom he laid down his life; who are described as being
<i>without strength</i>, or ability to do what is good, and <i>ungodly</i>,
and so open enemies to him, Rom. v. 6, 8, 10. and therefore
there was nothing in us that could induce him to do this for
us. We are also to consider, that he died in our room and
stead, as <i>bearing our griefs, and carrying our sorrows</i>, Isa. liii.
4. and being <i>delivered for our offences</i>, Rom. iv. 25. And
we are also to consider the great ends designed thereby, as
God is hereby glorified, his holiness and justice in demanding
and receiving a full satisfaction for sin, illustrated in the highest
degree; so that he declares himself <i>well-pleased</i> in what
Christ has done and suffered, Matt. iii. 17. and <i>well-pleased</i>
likewise, as the prophet expresses it, <i>for his righteousness’
sake</i>, Isa. xlii. 21. We are also to consider the great advantage
that we hope to receive thereby, as <i>being justified by his
blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him</i>, Rom. v. 9.
This is therefore the highest inducement to us, to give up ourselves
entirely to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We are, in this ordinance, to stir up ourselves to a vigorous
exercise of those graces that the nature of the ordinance
requires: And accordingly we are,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) To judge ourselves; as the apostle says, <i>If we would
judge ourselves, we should not be judged</i>, 1 Cor. xi. 31. and
this we ought to do, by accusing, condemning, and passing
sentence against ourselves, for those sins which we have committed
against Christ, whereby we were plunged into the utmost
depths of misery, in which we should for ever have continued,
had he not redeemed us by his blood. We are also
to acknowledge our desert of God’s wrath and curse; so that
<i>if he should mark iniquity, we could not stand</i>, Psal. cxxx. 3.
and this sense of sin ought to be particular, including in it
those transgressions which are known to none but God and
ourselves; as we ought to make a particular application of the
blood of Christ for the forgiveness thereof. This is certainly
very suitable to the nature of the ordinance we are engaged
in, wherein Christ is set forth as a sacrifice for sin, and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>are led, at the same time, to be duly affected with our malady,
and the great remedy God has provided; which will have a
tendency to enhance our praise and thankfulness to him, who
loved us, and gave himself for us.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We are to exercise a godly sorrow for sin, which is the
ground of all that distress and misery which we are liable to:
This ought to take its rise from the corruption of nature, from
whence all actual sins proceed; and we are to bewail our sins
of omission, as well as commission; our neglect to perform
duties that are incumbent on us, as well as those sins that have
been committed by us with the greatest presumption, deliberation,
wilfulness, and obstinacy, which contain in them the
highest ingratitude and contempt of the blood of Christ, and
the method of salvation by him. And this sorrow for sin
ought to produce those good effects of praying and striving
against it, endeavouring to return to God, from whom we
have backslidden. The apostle calls it, <i>sorrowing after a
godly sort</i>; and speaks of it as attended with <i>carefulness</i>, that
we may avoid it for the future; <i>clearing of ourselves</i>, so that
we may either be encouraged to hope that we have not committed
the sins which we are ready to charge ourselves with,
or, that the guilt thereof is taken away by the atonement that
Christ has made for us. It ought also to produce an holy <i>indignation</i>,
and a kind of revenge against sin, as that which
has been so prejudicial to us; as likewise a <i>fear</i> of offending;
a <i>zeal</i> for the glory of God, whom we have dishonoured; and
a <i>vehement desire</i> of those blessings which we have hereby
forfeited. This sorrow for sin ought to proceed from an inward
loathing and abhorrence of it; and the degree thereof
ought to bear some proportion to its respective aggravations,
and the dishonour we have brought to God thereby; which
would be an effectual means to incline us to abhor ourselves,
and repent in dust and ashes.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is very agreeable to the nature of the ordinance we
are engaged in, since nothing tends more to enhance the vile
and heinous nature of sin, than the consideration of its having
crucified the Lord of glory; which is to be the immediate subject
of our meditation therein. We read that Christ, in his
last sufferings, was <i>exceeding sorrowful, even unto death</i>,
Matt. xxvi. 38. which could not proceed from the afflictive
view that he had of the pains and indignities he was to suffer
in his crucifixion; for that would argue him to have a less
degree of holy courage and resolution than some of the martyrs
have expressed when they have endured extreme torments, and
most ignominious reproaches for his sake: Therefore his sorrow
proceeded from the afflictive sense that he had of the guilt
of our sins which he bore. If therefore he not only suffered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>but his soul was exceeding sorrowful for our sins; this ought
to excite in us the exercise of that grace in this ordinance, in
which it is brought to our remembrance.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) We are to hunger and thirst after Christ; which implies
in it an ardent desire of having communion with him:
Thus the church says, <i>With my soul have I desired thee in the
night; yea, with my spirit will I seek thee early</i>, Isa. xxvi. 9.
and the Psalmist compares this to the hunted <i>hart</i>, that is ready
to die for thirst, which <i>pants after the water-brooks</i>, Psal. xlii.
1. This arises from a deep sense of our need of Christ, and
farther supplies of grace from him, and is attended with a
firm resolution that nothing short of him shall satisfy us, as
not being adapted to supply our wants. Such a frame of spirit
is agreeable to the ordinance we are engaged in, since Christ
is therein represented as having purchased, and being ready to
apply to his people, those blessings which are of a satisfying
and comforting nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) We are to feed on Christ by faith, and thereby receive
of his fulness, as he is frequently represented in scripture, under
the metaphor of <i>food</i>: Thus he styles himself, <i>The bread
of life</i>, John vi. 35. and the blessings he bestows, are called,
‘The meat which perisheth not, but endureth to everlasting
life,’ ver. 27. and the gospel-dispensation is set forth by a
‘feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things
full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined,’ Isa. xxv.
6. Thus our Saviour also represents it in the parable, Matt.
xxii. 4. in which he commands his servants to invite those that
were bidden to the marriage-feast, by telling them what things
he had prepared for their entertainment, as an encouragement
to their faith. Thus we are to consider that fulness of grace
that is in Christ, (when drawing nigh to him in this ordinance,)
of merit, for our justification, of strength to enable us to
mortify sin, and resist temptations, of wisdom to direct us in
all emergencies and difficulties, of peace and comfort, to revive
and encourage us under all our doubts and fears, and to
give us suitable relief when we are ready to faint under the
burdens we complain of. All these blessings are to be apprehended
and applied by faith, otherwise we cannot conclude that
they belong to us; and nothing can be more adapted to this
ordinance, wherein Christ is represented as having all those
blessings to bestow, which he has purchased by his blood, and
these are signified or shewed forth therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) We are, in this ordinance, to trust in the merits of
Christ, or to exercise an entire confidence in him, who, by his
death, has purchased for us all spiritual and saving blessings.
This ought to be attended with an humble sense of our
own unworthiness, as being <i>less than the least of all God’s mercies</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Gen. xxxii. 10. and as deserving nothing but his fierce
wrath for our iniquities. And, since he has paid a full and
satisfactory price of redemption for us, and thereby procured
the blessings that we had forfeited, which have a tendency to
make us completely happy, we ought to lay the whole stress
of our salvation on him, as being sensible that <i>he is able to
save to the uttermost, all that come unto God by him</i>, Heb.
xii. 25.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) We are to rejoice in Christ’s love, which is infinitely
greater than what can be in the heart of one creature towards
another: This love of Christ has several properties;</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, It doth not consist merely in his desiring our good, or
wishing that we were happy, but in making us so; nor does it
only consist in his sympathizing with us in our miseries, but
delivering us from them, and discovering himself as our refuge
and strength, a very present help in trouble.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, As Christ’s love to his people did not take its motive
at first from any beauty or excellency which he found in them
who were deformed, polluted, and worthy to be abhorred by
him, but afterwards adorned and <i>made comely through his
comeliness put upon them</i>, Ezek. xvi. 14. so when they forfeit
his love by their frequent backslidings, and deserve to be cast
off by him, it is nevertheless unchangeably fixed upon them,
inasmuch as <i>having loved his own which were in the world, he
loved them unto the end</i>, John xiii. 1.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Christ’s love is infinitely condescending, which arises
not only from that infinite distance which there is between him
and his people, but from his remembring them in their low
estate, having compassion on them whom no eye pitied, and
saving them when they were in the utmost depths of despair
and misery, <i>saying to them when they were in their blood, live</i>,
Ezek. xvi. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, It is not like the love of strangers, which contents itself
with some general endeavours to do good to them whom
they design not to contract an intimacy with, but it is attended
with the highest acts of friendship and communion, imparting
his secrets to them, as he promises <i>to love, and manifest himself
to them</i>, John xiv. 21. and tells his disciples, ‘Henceforth
I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his
lord doeth: But I have called you friends; for all things that
I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you,’
chap. xv. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>5thly</i>, It is such a love as forgives all former injuries, and
upbraids not his people for what they have done against him,
either before or since they believed in him. Thus God is said
to ‘pardon the iniquity, and pass by the transgression of the
remnant of his heritage,’ and ‘to cast all their sins into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>depths of the sea,’ Micah vii. 18, 19. and ‘to blot out their
transgressions for his own sake, and not to remember their
sins,’ Isa. xliii. 25.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>6thly</i>, It is such a love as affords us all seasonable and necessary
help in times of our greatest straights and difficulties,
Psal. xlvi. 1. and makes provision for our future necessities;
as he tells his disciples, <i>I go to prepare a place for you</i>, John
xiv. 2. that they might be assured of being happy in another
world; and accordingly he expresses himself in his mediatorial
prayer, ‘Father, I will that these whom thou hast given
me, may be with me where I am, that they may behold my
glory,’ John xvii. 24.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>7thly</i>, It is such a love, as puts him upon reckoning all injuries
done against his people, as though they were done against
himself, and the kindnesses expressed to them, as though they
were expressed to him, as it is said, <i>He that toucheth you,
toucheth the apple of his eye</i>, Zech. ii. 8. and, <i>he that despiseth
you, despiseth me</i>, Luke x. 16. And, when he takes notice of
those expressions of kindness, which his people had shewn
to one another, he says, <i>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one
of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me</i>, Mat.
xxv. 40.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>8thly</i>, It is such a love as inclines him to interpose himself
between his people and all danger, whereby he prevents their
being overcome by their enemies; and indeed, he not only
hazarded, but as <i>a good shepherd gave his life for his sheep</i>,
John x. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is that love which is to be the subject of our meditation
in this ordinance; accordingly we are first to endeavour,
to make out our interest in him, by faith, which will be
evinced by those acts of love to him that flow from it, and
then we may rejoice in it as a constant spring of peace and
blessedness.</p>

<p class='c006'>(7.) The next grace to be exercised in this ordinance, is
thankfulness, adoring and praising him that he has been pleased
to extend compassion to us in bestowing those blessings,
which are the result of his discriminating grace, the instances
whereof are various, <i>viz.</i> as he delivers us from the ruin that
sin would have inevitably brought upon us, prevents us with
the blessings of goodness, and restrains the breaking forth of
our corruptions, which would otherwise have inclined us to
commit the vilest abominations; and, more especially, as he
renews our nature, changes our hearts, creates us unto good
works, and then quickens and excites that grace in us which
his own hand wrought, and comforts us when our spirits are
overwhelmed with sorrow, whereby he enables us to go on in his
way rejoicing, and so carries on the work which he has begun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>in us, till it be completed in glory. There is nothing that we
have, either in hand or hope, but what will afford matter for
the exercise of this grace; and more particularly, our hearts
ought to be excited hereunto from the consideration of the benefits
that are signified in this ordinance; especially if we are
enabled to receive them by faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>(8.) We are, at the Lord’s supper, to renew our covenant
with God. That this may be rightly understood, we must
consider what it is for a believer to enter into covenant with
God, which he is supposed to have done before this; and that
consists not in our promising that we will do these things that
are out of our power, or, that we will exercise those graces,
which none but God, who works in his people, both to will
and to do, can enable us to put forth; but it consists in our
making a surrender of ourselves to Christ, and depending on
him for the supply of all our spiritual wants, humbly hoping
and trusting that he will enable us to adhere stedfastly to him,
working in us all that grace which he requires of us; which
blessing if he is pleased to grant us, we shall be enabled to
perform all the duties that are incumbent on us, how difficult
soever they may be. This is an unexceptionable way of entering
into covenant with God, as it contains an acknowledgement
of our own inability to do that which is good without
him, and desire to give the glory of all to him; on whom we
stedfastly rely, that we may obtain mercy from him to be
faithful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, to renew our covenant, is to declare, that through
his grace, we are inclined stedfastly to adhere to our solemn
dedication to him, not, in the least, repenting of what we did
therein; and, that we have as much reason to depend on his
assistance now, as we had at first, since grace is carried on,
as well as begun by him alone; and accordingly, while we
express our earnest desire to be stedfast in his covenant, we
depend on his promise that he will never fail us, nor forsake
us: And we take this occasion, more especially, to renew our
dedication to him, as it is very agreeable to the nature of this
ordinance, in which we have the external symbols of his love
to us, which lays us under the highest obligation thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>(9.) We are, in this ordinance, to shew our readiness to
exercise a Christian love to all saints; which consists, more
especially, in our earnest desire that all grace and peace may
abound in them, as in our own souls; that hereby we may
have occasion to glorify God together, and shew our mutual
concern for the spiritual welfare of each other. We are to
bless God for the grace they are enabled to exercise, though,
it may be, we cannot exercise it in the same degree ourselves:
And, as for others, we are to sympathize with them in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>weaknesses, grieve for their falls and miscarriages; and be
very ready to make abatements for those frailties and infirmities
that we behold in them, which we ourselves are sometimes
liable to, especially if they are not inconsistent with
grace, in which case we should cast a mantle of love over
them, not knowing but we may be exposed to, and fall by
the same temptations.</p>

<p class='c006'>This love is to be expressed, more especially in this ordinance;
inasmuch as we are to consider all saints as members
of Christ’s mystical body, children of the same God and Father,
partakers of the same grace with us, fellow travellers to
the same heavenly country, where we hope to meet with them
at last, though now they are liable to the same difficulties with
ourselves, and exposed to those assaults and temptations that
we often meet with from our spiritual enemies. This expression
of our love, though it be more immediately and directly
extended to the same society, that joins in communion with
us; yet it is not to be confined within such narrow limits, but
includes in it the highest esteem for all who are sanctified in
Christ Jesus, called to be saints, though their place of abode
be remote from, and they are not known to us in the flesh.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We are now to consider the duty of Christians after they
have received the sacrament of the Lord’s supper; and that
consists in enquiring, how they have behaved themselves therein?
and, whether they have any ground to conclude, that they
have been favoured with the special presence of God in this
ordinance, whereby it has been made a means of grace to
them?</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the former of these enquiries relating to the frame of
our spirits, while engaging in this solemn duty, we shall sometimes
find, that it has been such as affords matter for deep humiliation
and self-abasement, in the sight of God, when we reflect
upon it; particularly,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. When our minds and affections have been conversant
about those things, which are altogether unsuitable to the work
we have been engaged in, and, instead of conversing with
Christ in this ordinance, we have had our thoughts and meditations
most taken up with worldly matters; or, if they have,
indeed, been conversant about religious affairs, yet we may, in
some measure, see reason to blame ourselves, if these have
been altogether foreign to the great end and design of the ordinance
we have been engaged in. There are many portions
of scripture, or heads of divinity founded upon it, which we
may employ our thoughts about at other times, with great advantage;
yet they may not be altogether suitable, or adapted
to our receiving spiritual advantage by, or making a right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>improvement of Christ crucified, as the nature of this ordinance
requires.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. They behave themselves unbecomingly, in this ordinance,
who meditate on the thing signified therein, to wit, the dying
love of Jesus Christ, as though they were unconcerned spectators,
having only an historical faith, and content themselves
with the bare knowledge of what relates to the life and death
of Christ, without considering the end and design thereof, <i>viz.</i>
that he might make atonement for sin, or their particular
concern herein, so as to improve it, as an expedient for
the taking away the guilt and power thereof in their own
souls.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We may reflect on our behaviour in this ordinance,
when we have given way to deadness and stupidity, without
using those endeavours that are necessary for the exciting our
affections; when a subject so affecting as Christ’s pouring out
his soul unto death, being wounded for our transgressions, despised
and rejected of men, bleeding and dying on the cross,
and, in the midst of his sufferings, crying out, <i>My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me</i>, has not had an efficacy to
raise our affections, any more than if it were a common
subject?</p>

<p class='c006'>4. We have reason to blame our behaviour in this ordinance,
when we have attended on it with a resolution to continue
in any known sin, without being earnest with God to
mortify it, or desiring strength and grace from Christ, in order
thereunto, and improving his death for that end. Thus we
have reason, sometimes, to reflect on our behaviour at the
Lord’s supper, with grief, and sorrow of heart, as what has
been disagreeable to the nature of the ordinance we have been
engaged in.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, on the other hand, we may, sometimes, in taking a
view of our behaviour therein, find matter of encouragement,
when, abating for human frailties, and the imperfection of
grace, that inseparably attends this present state, we can say,
to the glory of God, that we have, in some measure, behaved
ourselves as we ought to do. Thus when we have found,
that our hearts have been duly affected with the love of Christ,
and we have had the exercise of those graces that are suitable
thereunto; and if we can say, that we have had some communion
with him, and have not been altogether destitute of his
quickening and comforting presence, and the witness of his
Spirit with ours, that we are the children of God; then we
may conclude, that we have engaged in this ordinance in a
right manner. And if we have found that it has been thus
with us, we are to bless God for it, as considering that he
alone can excite grace in us, who wrought it at first. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>we are farther to consider, that such-like acts of grace will
be a good evidence of the truth and sincerity thereof; whereby
our comforts may be more established, and we enabled to
walk more closely and thankfully with God, by the communication
of those graces that he is pleased to bestow upon us in
this ordinance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, if we have had experience of the presence of
God therein, and have been brought into a good frame, we
ought to beg the continuance thereof. The best frame of spirit
will be no longer abiding, than it pleases God to keep up
the lively exercise of faith and other graces; and this, being
so valuable a blessing, is to be sought for by fervent prayer and
supplication, that our good frames may not be like the morning
cloud, or early dew, that soon passes away: This will discover,
that we set a value upon them, and glorify God as the
author of them; and it is the best expedient for our walking
with God at other times, as well as when engaged in holy ordinances.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, it is farther observed, that they, who have been
quickened and comforted, when partaking of the Lord’s supper,
ought to watch against relapses into those sins, that formerly
they have been overtaken with, but now see reason to
abhor. This we ought to do, because, though we are sometimes
brought into a good frame, yet still we have deceitful
hearts, that, before we are aware, may betray us into the
commission of those sins which have occasioned great distress
to us in times past; and, to this we may add, the endeavours
of Satan to ensnare us by his wiles; so, that when
we think ourselves the safest, we may be exposed to the greatest
dangers. When we have been least apprehensive of our
return to our former sins, and, it may be, have been too secure
in our opinion, while confiding too much to our own strength,
we have lost those good frames, and our troubles have been renewed
thereby: Therefore, it is our duty to watch against the
secret workings of corrupt nature, and the first motions of sin
in our hearts, while we earnestly implore help from God, that
we may be kept from our own iniquities; namely, those sins
that we have formerly committed, or that more easily beset us
than any other.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next duty incumbent on us, after we have received the
Lord’s supper, is, to fulfil our vows: This will be better unstood,
if compared with what was before observed concerning
sacramental vows or covenants: which ought not to contain in
them a making promises, especially in our own strength, that
we will be found in the exercise of those graces which are the
special gift and effects of God’s almighty power. Therefore, I
always, when occasionally mentioning making religious vows,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>consider them principally as containing an express declaration,
that we are under an indispensable obligation to perform those
duties, and put forth those acts of grace which are incumbent
on us, as those who desire to approve ourselves Christ’s faithful
servants, whom he has taken into a covenant-relation with
himself. We also declare, that without help from God we can
do nothing: This help we implore from him, at the same time
when we devote, or give up ourselves to him; so that we do
this, hoping and trusting that he will bestow upon us that grace
which is out of our own power; which, if he will be pleased to
do, we determine that he shall have all the glory that arises
from it. This is most agreeable to the sense of the Latin
word<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c012'><sup>[102]</sup></a>; from whence the word <i>vow</i> is derived; and, I think,
it is much rather to be acquiesced in, than that general description
which some give to it, when they exhort those who are
engaged in this ordinance, first to confess those sins which they
have committed since they were last at the Lord’s table, so far
as they occur to their memories; and, as a means of their obtaining
forgiveness, to make a solemn vow, or promise, that
they will abstain from them for the future, and walk more
agreeably to the engagements which they are laid under: This
they do without an humble sense of the treachery of their own
hearts, or their need of strength from God, to perform any
thing that is good; and afterwards, they are as little inclined
to fulfil their own promises, as they were before forward to
make them, with too much reliance on their own strength;
and, by this means, they bring themselves into the greatest
perplexities, and go on, as it were, in a round of making solemn
vows and resolutions, and then breaking them, and afterwards
renewing them again: Whereas, when we intend nothing
by our vowing, but a confessing that what others promise
in their own strength, we see ourselves obliged to do; and, at
the same time, depend on Christ for strength to enable us to
perform it, and give up ourselves to him, as his covenant-people,
in hope thereof; this is the safest way of vowing, inasmuch as it
redounds most to the honour of God, and contains every thing
in it that may put us upon using our utmost endeavours to perform
the duties that are incumbent on us, and, at the same time,
we express our unfeigned desire to glorify him as the God and
Author of that grace, which is necessary thereunto. And, in
this sense I would understand what we are exhorted to in the
answers we are explaining, when it is said, in one of them, that
while we are receiving the Lord’s supper, we ought to renew
our covenant with God; and after we have received it, we are
to fulfil our vows, as it is expressed in the other; as the former
includes in it such a dedication to God as has been but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>now considered; the latter, to wit, the fulfilling our vows,
implies in it a doing every thing that is in our power, in order
thereunto; and, at the same time, a waiting on God to
give success to our endeavours, and to work in us that
which is well-pleasing in his sight, without which we can do
nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'>After we have waited on the Lord in this ordinance, we are
to encourage ourselves to a frequent attendance thereon; especially
if we have ground to conclude, that we have had any
sensible communications of his grace vouchsafed to us therein.
As this is an honour which God puts on his own institutions,
it is certainly an encouragement to us, to persevere in waiting
on him therein. Thus the Psalmist says, <i>Because he hath inclined
his ear unto me, therefore I call upon him as long as
I live</i>, Psal. cxvi. 2. This will effectually remove all those
doubts and scruples that discourage us from engaging in this
ordinance, lest we should not behave ourselves in a right manner
therein, fearing that we are not sufficiently prepared for it,
and therefore shall be disowned by Christ, when we engage in
it: I say, this we are fenced against, by having experienced
his quickening and comforting presence therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, suppose we have not met with this desirable blessing,
which the best believers do not experience in a like degree, at
all times; then we ought, after we have received the Lord’s
Supper, to endeavour to find out the particular cause of God’s
withdrawing his special presence from us, and what is that
root of bitterness which springs up and troubles us. It may be,
he withholds this privilege from us in a way of sovereignty,
that we may hereby learn that our comforts are not at our own
disposal; or, that they are not the necessary result of our attendance
on ordinances, but arise from the divine blessing accompanying
them. This, God, it may be, withholds from us
for the trial of our graces; and that we may see how needful
it is for us to wait for those spiritual comforts, which, at present,
he withholds from us; as the prophet says, <i>Therefore
will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore
will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you; for
the Lord is a God of judgment; blessed are they that wait for
him</i>, Isa. xxx. 18.</p>

<p class='c006'>But since we may, for the most part, apprehend some particular
reason why God denies us his quickening, and comforting
presence, arising from sins of omission or commission, antecedent
to, or whilst we have been engaged in this ordinance:
We must enquire,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Whether there has not been some defect, as to preparatory
duties? and particularly, whether we have duly examined
ourselves before we came to the Lord’s table, concerning our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>knowledge of Christ, and the benefits of his redemption; or,
especially, of our being enabled to improve them by faith? and,
whether we have examined ourselves concerning the sense we
have of the guilt of sin, and the need we stand in of Christ’s
righteousness, to take it away, and accordingly resolved to
wait on him in this ordinance, with earnest desires of obtaining
this privilege.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We must enquire, whether our behaviour when we have
been engaged in this ordinance, has not been, in some measure,
unbecoming the spirituality and importance thereof? whether
we have not spared, or indulged, some secret corruption, that
has broke forth therein? or, whether we have not given way
to some temptation, that has then beset us? whether we have
not depended on our own righteousness, for the taking away
the guilt of sin, and procuring for us acceptance in the sight
of God? or, whether we have not engaged in this ordinance,
in our own strength, and by this self-confidence, provoked him
to withdraw from us; which, if we have, it will afford matter
of deep humiliation in his sight, and call for repentance and
reformation, if we would be fenced against this inconvenience,
which, at present we labour under; and then we may hope
that we shall be enabled to wait on him in this ordinance, in
such a way, that we may have those comfortable experiences
of grace from him, which will be an evidence that we have
waited on him for the better, and not for the worse.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXXVI., CLXXVII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXVI.</span> <i>Wherein do the sacraments of Baptism and
the Lord’s Supper agree?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper,
agree, in that the author of both is God, the spiritual part
of both is Christ and his benefits; both are seals of the same
covenant, are to be dispensed by ministers of the gospel,
and by none other, and to be continued in the church of
Christ, until his second coming.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXVII.</span> <i>Wherein do the sacraments of Baptism
and the Lord’s Supper differ?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s supper
differ, in that baptism is to be administered but once with
water, to be a sign and seal of our regeneration, and ingrafting
into Christ, and that even to infants, whereas the Lord’s
supper is to be administered often, in the elements of bread
and wine, to represent and exhibit Christ as spiritual nourishment
to the soul, and to confirm our continuance and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>growth in him, and that only to such as are of years and
ability to examine themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>These two answers contain little more than a recapitulation
of some things, that have been occasionally mentioned,
in explaining the nature of these ordinances; and therefore
we shall very briefly insist on them.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Concerning those things wherein the sacraments of baptism
and the Lord’s supper agree; accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. It is observed, that God is the Author of both. This
may be inferred from what has been said concerning their being
holy ordinances, or means of grace; in which we are to
expect his presence and blessing to make them effectual to
salvation: This we cannot do without engaging in them by his
own warrant, which he has been pleased to give us, as appears
from his word, and the experience of many believers, who have
found sensible advantage thereby; so that the effects of his
power and grace, that have been produced in their hearts,
when engaged therein, afford a convincing evidence that God
is the Author thereof. This, as to what concerns baptism,
respects more especially, the baptism of those that are adult;
for when infants are baptized, though God can, and sometimes
does, as is more than probable, own this ordinance, by regenerating
them at that time; yet this cannot be known by us, unless
it be inferred, from those extraordinary communications
of grace which they may experience, who are enabled, by faith
to give up their children to God therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Baptism and the Lord’s supper farther agree, in that
Christ, and his benefits are signified by both of them: for they
are, each of them, ordinances for our faith, as they are signs
and seals of the covenant of grace, in which Christ, and the
benefits of his redemption, are set forth: Thus the apostle
says, with respect to baptism, <i>So many of as were baptized
into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death, buried with him
by baptism into death</i>, Rom. vi. 3, 4. accordingly we have
communion with Christ as crucified, dying and buried, and,
after this, rising again from the dead, whereby he brought the
work of redemption to perfection: These things are signified;
and thus our faith is to make use of this sign in baptism; and
the apostle says the same thing with respect to the Lord’s
Supper: <i>As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye
do shew the Lord’s death till he come</i>, 1 Cor. xi. 26.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Baptism and the Lord’s supper, are farther observed to
agree, in that they are to be dispensed by none but the ministers
of the gospel. Under the Old Testament-dispensation,
where all the parts of the temple-service were significant signs
of Christ, and the benefits of the covenant of grace; these were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>to be administered by none but those who were qualified, called,
and lawfully set apart to that work, as the apostle says, <i>No
man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of
God, as was Aaron</i>, Heb. v. 4. And we may conclude, that the
moral reason of the thing extends itself to the administration
of the seals of the covenant, under the gospel-dispensation. It
is certain, that some must be appointed, or set apart to this
work, otherwise it would belong to every body, and consequently
there would be no determinate administrators of these
ordinances, who might be said to have a special call thereunto,
from God and man. It may also be inferred from those scriptures
that speak of <i>pastors after God’s own heart</i>, who are to
<i>feed</i> his people <i>with knowledge and understanding</i>, as being his
special <i>gift</i>, Jer. iii. 15. and from what the apostle says, concerning
gospel-ministers, whether extraordinary or ordinary,
as being Christ’s <i>gift</i>, when he <i>ascended up on high</i>, Eph. iv.
8, 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. It is farther observed, that these two ordinances agree, in
that they are both to be continued in the church, until Christ’s
second coming. Though we look and hope for more of the
presence of God therein, and a greater effusion of his Spirit,
to make them more effectual, and render the church more
bright and glorious, as being favoured with greater degrees of
the communications of divine grace; yet we have no ground
to expect new ordinances, or a new dispensation to succeed
this we are under, till Christ’s second and most glorious coming;
therefore this is called, <i>The last time</i>, 1 John ii. 18. Upon
which account the apostle says, that <i>the ends of the world
are come upon us</i>, 1 Cor. x. 11. by which we are to understand,
that the present dispensation of the gospel that we
are under, is the last we are to expect till Christ’s second
coming.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this also appears, from the promise which Christ has
given of his presence with his ministers and churches, when
faithfully engaging in these ordinances, as he says, <i>Lo, I am
with you always, even unto the end of the world</i>, Matt. xxviii.
20. And, as his <i>death</i>, as was before observed, is to be <i>shewed
forth till he come</i>, 1 Cor. xi. 26. this proves that the Lord’s
supper is also to be continued in the church till then. This I
would the rather observe, inasmuch as it is contrary to what
some maintain, who, while they hope for a greater effusion of
the Spirit, and a more glorious state of the church in the latter
day, are ready to extend their thoughts too far, they conclude
that it will be a new dispensation, as the ordinances which the
church is favoured with, at present, shall cease, particularly
baptism and the Lord’s Supper; which we can by no means
approve of.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>II. We are now to consider wherein the sacraments of baptism
and the Lord’s supper differ.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. It is observed that they differ, in that baptism is to be administered
but once; whereas, the Lord’s supper is to be administered
often. This appears from two different circumstances
contained in them. As for baptism, it signifies our first ingrafting
into, or putting on Christ; and when denominated
from the thing signified thereby, it is called, the <i>washing of
regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost</i>, Titus iii. 5.
which is hoped for in this ordinance; accordingly it is considered
as our first solemn dedication to Christ; and, as this is
signified thereby, it is called an initiating ordinance, in which
we are bound to be the Lord’s; which bond holds good as
long as we live, and therefore needs not to be signified, sealed,
or confirmed by our being baptized a second time: But,
on the other hand, the Lord’s supper signifies our feeding or
living upon Christ, and receiving daily supplies of grace from
him, as our necessities require: Therefore this ordinance
differs from baptism as it is often to be engaged in.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. They differ, in that the former as has been before proved,
is not only to be applied to the adult, if they have not been
baptized before, but to the infants of believing parents, which
the Lord’s supper is not. In baptism, the person dedicated may
be considered as being passive, and so devoted to God by the
faith of another, who has a right to do this: But none are
to partake of the Lord’s supper but those who have such a
degree of knowledge, that they are able to discern the Lord’s
body, and capable of performing that duty which the apostle
recommends as necessary thereunto, when he says, <i>Let a man
examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of
that cup</i>, 1 Cor. xi. 28.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am sensible that some of the ancient church, and particularly
Cyprian, in the third century, have pleaded for, and practised
the administration of the Lord’s supper to infants, being
led into this mistake, by supposing what does not sufficiently
appear, <i>viz.</i> that infants among the Jews ate the passover, because
whole families are said to eat it. But this does not appear
to include infants; for whom another sort of food was
designed: neither could they reap any advantage by it, not
being capable of discerning the thing signified, or feeding on
Christ, the true Paschal Lamb; which could be done no otherwise
than by faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>Others were led into this mistake from the wrong sense they
gave of that scripture, in which Christ says, <i>Except ye eat the
flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in
you</i>, John vi. 53. thinking that our Saviour meant hereby, the
bread and wine in the Lord’s supper. Therefore this ordinance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>was absolutely necessary to salvation; upon which account
they thought that it ought to be extended to infants, as a
means of their obtaining it. But it is certain this cannot be
the meaning of that scripture, since the Lord’s supper was not
instituted, or known in the church, when our Saviour spake
these words: Therefore, he intends nothing else thereby but
the fiducial application of Christ’s death, as an expedient for
our obtaining eternal life.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXXVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXVIII.</span> <i>Which is Prayer?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Prayer is an offering up of our desires unto God, in
the name of Christ, by the help of his Spirit, with confession
of our sins, and thankful acknowledgment of his mercies.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having considered the things that are to be believed
and done; what remains is, to enquire concerning those
things that are to be prayed for, and how this great duty of
prayer is to be performed. This is necessary to be insisted on,
inasmuch as we are obliged to yield obedience to the revealed
will of God; nevertheless, by reason of our depravity and
weakness, we can do nothing that is good without his assistance,
which is not to be expected, unless it be humbly desired
of him; and this is what we generally call <i>prayer</i>; which being
performed by creatures who are not only indigent, but unworthy,
this is to be acknowledged, and accordingly we are,
in prayer, to confess sin as the principal ground and reason of
this unworthiness. And, inasmuch as God has been pleased
to encourage us to hope, that we shall not seek his face in vain,
who, in many instances is pleased to grant returns of prayer;
this obliges us to draw nigh to him with thanksgiving. These
things are particularly contained in the answer we are explaining;
and the method in which we shall endeavour to speak to
it, is to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. What, prayer supposes; and that is,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That we are dependent and indigent creatures, have many
wants to be supplied, sins to be forgiven, miseries, under which
we need pity and relief, and weaknesses, under which we want
to be strengthened and assisted in the performance of the duties
that are incumbent on us. From hence it may be inferred, that
though our Lord Jesus Christ is often represented as praying
to God, this is an action performed by him in his human nature;
in which alone he could be said to be indigent, who, in
his divine nature, is all-sufficient.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It supposes that God, who is the object of prayer, is regarded
by us, not only as able, but willing to help us; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>that he has encouraged us to draw nigh to him for relief: And
therefore it is a duty that more especially belongs to those who
are favoured with the hope of the gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We shall now shew how prayer is to be considered, as
to the various kinds hereof; and accordingly we are represented
as drawing nigh to God, with an humble sense of our secret
sins and wants, which none but God and our own consciences
are privy to. This kind of prayer our Saviour intends, when
he says, <i>Thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret,
and thy Father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly</i>,
Mat. vi. 6. and we have an instance hereof in himself; inasmuch,
as it is said, that <i>when he had sent the multitudes away,
he went up into a mountain apart to pray</i>, chap. xiv. 23. also,
<i>Peter went up upon the house-top to pray</i>, Acts x. 9. in which,
being retired from the world, he had a greater liberty to pour
forth his soul unto God.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we are to join with others in performing this
duty, in which we confess those sins, and implore a supply of
those wants that are common to all who are engaged therein:
This our Saviour encourages us to do, when he says, <i>If two of
you shall agree on earth, as touching any thing that they shall
ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
am I in the midst of them</i>, Mat. xviii. 19, 20. This is a branch
of social worship, and is to be performed by every family apart,
whereof we have an example in Cornelius, concerning whom it
is said, that he was <i>a devout man, and feared God with all his
house, and prayed to him always</i>; and that he did this, at certain
times, <i>in his house</i>, Acts x. 2. compared with ver. 30.
Moreover, this duty is to be performed publicly in the church,
or any worshipping assembly met together for that purpose:
Of this we have an instance in the apostle Paul, who, when he
had called for the elders of the church at Ephesus, designing
to take his leave of them, after an affectionate discourse, and
suitable advice given to them, he <i>kneeled down and prayed with
them all</i>, chap. xx. 36.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, prayer may be considered as that for which a stated
time is set apart by us, either alone, or with others; or, that
which is occasional, short, and ejaculatory, consisting in a secret
lifting up of our hearts to God, and may be done when we
are engaged in other business of a different nature, without being
a let or hindrance to it: Thus it is said that <i>Nehemiah
prayed</i>, when he has going to <i>deliver the cup into the king’s
hand</i>, between the king’s asking him a question, and his returning
him an answer to it; which seems to be the meaning of
what is said in Neh. ii. 4, 5. <i>Then the king said unto me; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>what dost thou make request? so I prayed to the God of heaven,
and I said unto the king</i>, &amp;c. These ejaculatory prayers are
either such as we put up to God while engaged in worldly business
for direction, assistance, or success therein; or when
attending on the word read or preached, or any other holy
duties, in which we lift up our hearts to him for his presence
therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The next thing to be considered, is, the various parts
of prayer; and these are three, <i>viz.</i> Confession of sin; petition
for a supply of our wants; and thanksgiving for mercies received.
Confession of sin supposes that we are guilty, and deserve
punishment from God; petition supposes, that we are
miserable and helpless; and thanksgiving implies, a disposition
to own God, the author of all the good we enjoy or hope
for, and includes in it a due sense of those undeserved favours
we have received from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this general account of the duty of prayer, and the
parts thereof, we may infer,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That the two former of them, namely, confession of sin,
and petition for relief, under the various miseries and distresses
which we are liable to, is only applicable to those who
are in a sinful and imperfect state, as believers are in this
world. As for glorified saints in heaven, they have no sins to
be confessed, nor any miseries under which they need help and
pity. As for that part of prayer which consists of thanksgiving
for mercies already received, that, indeed, is agreeable to a
perfect state, and is represented as the constant work of glorified
saints: Thus the Psalmist says, <i>The heavens</i>, that is, the
inhabitants thereof, <i>shall praise thy wonders, O Lord, thy faithfulness
also in the congregation of the saints</i>, Psal. lxxxix. 5.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Sinners, who have lost their day of grace, against whom
the door of hope and mercy is shut, who are enduring the
punishment of sin in hell, these are not properly the subjects
of prayer; concerning whom it may be said, not only that
they cannot pray, being destitute of those graces that are necessary
thereunto; but having no interest in a Mediator, or in
the promises of the covenant of grace, which are a warrant
and encouragement for the performance of this duty.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. In this world, wherein we enjoy the means of grace, none
are the subjects of prayer but man. The Psalmist, indeed,
speaks of God’s <i>giving to the beast his food, and to the young
ravens which cry</i>, Psal. cxlvii. 9. and elsewhere it is said, <i>He
provideth for the raven his food, when his young ones cry unto
God</i>, Job. xxxviii. 41. The meaning of which is, not that
brute creatures formally address themselves to God for a supply
of their wants, having no idea of a divine being; but, that,
when they complain for want of food, the providence of God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>supplies them, though they know not the hand from whence it
comes.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Though it be the duty of all men in the world to pray;
yet none can do this by faith, and, consequently, in an acceptable
manner, but believers, concerning whom the apostle says,
<i>Ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby they cry, Abba,
Father</i>, Rom. viii. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the first part of prayer, <i>viz.</i> petition, or supplication.
This will be particularly considered under several following
answers, and especially those that contain an explication of
the Lord’s prayer; which is a directory for what we are to
ask of God: Therefore we shall, at present, only consider
the other two parts of prayer, <i>viz.</i> confession of sin, and thanksgiving
for mercies.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Concerning confession of sin; and accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] We shall prove, that it is an indispensable duty incumbent
on all men; and that, not only on those who are in a
state of unregeneracy, and consequently under the dominion
of sin, but on believers themselves, who are in a justified state.
This will appear, if we consider, that not to confess sin, is, in
effect, to justify ourselves in the commission of it; and, as it
were, to deny that which is so well known to the heart-searching
God, as well as to our own consciences. It also contains
in it a charging God with injustice, when he inflicts on us
the punishment that is due to it; which is contrary to what
Ezra says; <i>Thou, our God, hast punished us less than our iniquities
deserve</i>, Ezra ix. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, none was ever truly humbled in the sight of
God, or obtained mercy and forgiveness of sin, but he was
first brought to confess it with suitable affection, and brokenness
of heart; which are ingredients in true repentance: Thus
it is said, <i>He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned,
and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; he
will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall
see the light</i>, Job xxxiii. 27, 28. It is also said elsewhere,
<i>He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: But whoso confesseth
and forsaketh them shall have mercy</i>, Prov. xxviii. 13. This
duty is so evident, that, one would think, no one, who duly
considers what he is, or how contrary his actions are to the revealed
will of God, should have the front to deny it: However,
it is well known, that many seem designedly to wave all
confession of sin in prayer; and, others argue against it, more
especially, as to what concerns the case of believers: Accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> It is objected, that believers ought not to confess
sin; since that is inconsistent with a justified state: It is, in
effect, to plead guilty, though God has taken away the guilt of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>sin, by forgiving it for the sake of the atonement which Christ
has made: It is a laying open the wound that God hath healed
and closed up, or bringing to remembrance that which he
hath said, <i>he will remember no more</i>, Heb. x. 67. and it is contrary
to the grace of God, who hath said, none shall <i>lay any
thing to the charge of</i> his <i>elect</i>, since <i>it is God that justifieth</i>,
Rom. viii. 33. for a believer to lay any thing to his own
charge, which he does when he confesses sin.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied;</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That we must distinguish between a believer’s desert of
punishment or condemnation, and his being actually punished
by God, as a sin-revenging judge, according as his iniquities
deserve. That a believer shall not eventually fall under condemnation,
is true, because his sins are forgiven; and with respect
to such, the apostle says, <i>There is now no condemnation to
them which are in Christ Jesus</i>, ver. 1. Nevertheless, though
he be in a justified state, and, as the consequence hereof, shall
be undoubtedly saved; yet, according to the tenor of his own
actions, he being a sinner, contracts guilt in the sight of God;
and, a desert of punishment is inseparably connected with
every sin, though a person may be in a justified state who
commits it. It is one thing to be liable to condemnation, and another
thing to deserve to be condemned: The former of these is,
indeed, inconsistent with a justified state; but the latter is not:
And it is in this sense that we are to understand the Psalmist’s
words, <i>If thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
stand</i>, Psal. cxxx. 3. And, accordingly, the best believer on
earth, though he have a full assurance of his being forgiven by
God; yet, inasmuch as he is a sinner, he is obliged to confess
that he deserves to be cast off by him, or, if God should
deal with him according to what he finds in him, without looking
upon him as he is in Christ, his head and surety, he would
be undone and lost for ever.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, Believers are daily sinning, and therefore contracting
fresh guilt; as it is said, <i>There is not a just man upon earth that
doeth good and sinneth not</i>, Eccl. vii. 20. and, indeed their sin
is sometimes so great, that they grieve the Holy Spirit, wound
their own consciences, and act very disagreeably to their character
as believers. This therefore ought to be confessed with
shame and self-abhorrence; as the prophet says, <i>That thou
mayest remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth
anymore, because of thy shame; when I am pacified towards
thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God</i>, Ezek. xvi.
63. Moreover, it is certain that believers, when they have
had a discovery that their sin was pardoned, have, at the same
time, confessed it with great humility. Thus, immediately
after Nathan had reproved David for his sin, and told him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>upon his repentance, that <i>the Lord had put it away</i>, 2 Sam.
xii. 13. yet he makes a penitent confession of it before God,
and says, <i>Against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this
evil in thy sight</i>, Psal. li. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] We shall now consider with what frame of spirit sin is
to be confessed; and this ought to be done,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, With a due sense of the infinite evil thereof, as it reflects
dishonour on the divine perfections; and particularly as
it is opposite to the holiness and purity of God, and a contempt
cast on his law, which expressly forbids it, and a disregarding
the threatenings denounced thereby against those who
violate it, and renders us liable to his wrath, as a sin-revenging
Judge, pursuant to the intrinsic demerit thereof: And therefore
it is justly styled <i>an evil thing and bitter</i>; the only thing
that can be called a moral evil; and it is certainly bitter in the
consequences thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, We are to confess sin with humility, shame, confusion
of face, and self-abhorrence; and that more especially, by reason
of the vile ingratitude there is in it, as committed by
those who are under the greatest engagements to the contrary
duties.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Sin is to be confessed with the hope of obtaining forgiveness
through the blood of Christ, as laying hold on the
promises of mercy, which are made to those who confess and
forsake it, Prov. xxviii. 13. and, with an earnest desire, to be
delivered from the prevailing power thereof, by strength derived
from Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] We shall now consider what sins we are to confess before
God; and these are, either the sin of our nature, or those
actual transgressions that proceed from it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, The sin of our nature. As fallen creatures, we are destitute
of the image of God; and, having contracted corrupt
habits, by repeated acts of rebellion against him, all the powers
and faculties of our souls are vitiated thereby, and we not only
indisposed and disinclined to what is good, but naturally bent
to backslide from God, and to commit the greatest abominations,
if destitute of his preventing, restraining, or renewing
grace: Thus the apostle says, <i>I know that in me, (that is, in
my flesh) dwelleth no good thing</i>, Rom. vii. 18. And this is
to be considered as what has universally defiled and depraved
our nature; and therefore we ought to cry out with the leper,
<i>Unclean, unclean</i>, Lev. xiii. 45. or, as the prophet say, <i>From
the sole of the foot even unto the head, there is no soundness in us,
but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores</i>, Isa. i. 6. We are
to consider it as that which insinuates itself into our best duties;
and it is like the fly in the precious ointment; and it is
of such a nature, that when we have been enabled to gain some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>advantage against it, it will afterwards recover strength. Notwithstanding
all our endeavours to the contrary. It is like an
incurable disease in the body, which, though we endeavour to
keep it under for a while, yet it will prevail again, till the
frame of nature is demolished, and thereby all diseases cured
at once: Nevertheless, when we confess and are humbled for
this propensity, that is in our nature to sin, we are to pray and
hope, that the prevailing power thereof may be so far weakened,
that, by the principle of grace, implanted in regeneration,
and excited by the Spirit, in promoting the work of sanctification,
though it dwells in us it may not entirely have dominion
over us, or we be thereby denominated the servants of sin.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, We are to confess the many actual sins that we daily
commit, with all their respective aggravations; sins of omission
and commission, both of which are contained in the apostle’s
confession; <i>The good that I would do, I do not; but the evil
which I would not, that I do</i>, Rom. vii. 19. Our sinful neglects
of duty are numberless; we are to confess our not
having redeemed our time, but spent it in those trifles and vain
amusements that profit not; particularly if we have misimproved
the very flower and best part of our time and strength,
and not remembered our Creator in the days of our youth.
This Job reckons the principal ground and reason of the evils
that befal him in his advanced age, when he says, <i>Thou writest
bitter things against me; and makest me to possess the iniquities
of my youth,</i> Job xiii. 26. And we are humbly to confess our
not having improved, and, thereby, lost many opportunities
for extraordinary service, either to do, or to get good: Thus
the prophet says, <i>Yea, the stork the heaven knoweth her appointed
times, and the turtle, and the crane, and the swallow observe
the time of their coming, but my people know not the judgment
of the Lord</i>, Jer. viii. 7. We are also to confess our neglecting
to comply with the calls and invitations of the gospel;
upon which account we are said, <i>to receive the grace of God in
vain,</i> 2 Cor. vi. 1. <i>or not to know the time of our visitation,</i>
Luke xix. 44. but when God has <i>called, we have refused;
when he has stretched out his hand, no man regarded, but have
set at nought all his counsel, and would none of his reproof</i>,
Prov. i. 24, 25. We are also to confess our neglect of public
and secret duties, or worshipping of God in a careless indifferent
manner; as the prophet represents the people, saying,
<i>Behold, what a weariness is it, and ye have snuffed at it, saith
the Lord of Hosts; and ye have brought that which was torn,
and the lame and the sick; should I accept this at your hands?</i>
Mal. i. 13. We are also to confess our neglect of relative duties,
in not instructing those under our care, nor reproving
them for sin committed, nor sympathizing with the afflicted,
nor warning those who are going out of God’s way; by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>means a multitude of sins might have been prevented, whereby
many have been ruined through our sinful neglect.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for sins of commission, which are also to be confessed;
these are either such as were committed before or after our
conversion to God; the former of which contain a disowning
his authority, or right to obedience; the latter, an ungrateful
disregard to, or forgetfulness of the greatest benefits received
from him. We are also to confess those sins which are contrary
to the moral law, or the very light of nature; which we
are often guilty of: And, that we may be furnished with matter,
and give scope to our thoughts and affections therein, it
may be of use for us to consider the sins forbidden under each
of the Ten Commandments, which have been before particularly
insisted on. We ought also to confess the various aggravations
of sin; and, to assist us therein, those things that
are contained in a foregoing answer<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c012'><sup>[103]</sup></a>, may be of some use
to us, especially if we make a particular application thereof to
our own case, and observe how far we have reason to fall under
a sense of guilt, or charge ourselves with crimes of the
like nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we are to confess the sins we have committed
against the engagements or grace of the gospel; the low
thoughts we have sometimes had of the person of Christ, his
love to us, or the benefits we have been made partakers of from
him, while we have been ready to say, as the daughters of
Jerusalem are represented speaking, <i>What is thy beloved more
than another beloved,</i> Cant. v. 9. and how much we have
hardened our hearts against him, refusing to submit to his
yoke, or bear his cross; how often we have been ashamed of
his cause and interest, especially when called to suffer reproach
for it. Have we not sometimes questioned the truth of
his promises, refused to submit to his righteousness, and depend
upon it alone for justification, while we have had too high
thoughts of ourselves, glorying and valuing ourselves upon the
performance of some moral duties, which we have put in the
room of Christ?</p>

<p class='c006'>We ought to confess how much we have opposed him in
all his offices; not depending on him as a prophet to lead us
in the way of truth and peace, but have leaned to our own understanding,
and therefore have been left to pervert, disbelieve,
or, at least, entertain some doubts about the great doctrines
of the gospel; or, if our minds have been rightly informed
therein, yet we have not made a practical improvement
thereof, for our spiritual advantage. Have we not opposed
him as a priest, and neglected to set a due value on that atonement
he has made for sin, not improving his intercession for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>us, who is entered into the holy place, made without hands,
to encourage us to come boldly to the throne of grace? Have
we not also refused to submit to him as king of saints, or seek
protection from him against the assaults of our spiritual enemies?
These things are to be confessed by us in prayer; and
that with such a sense of our own guilt, that we ought to acknowledge
ourselves to be, (as the apostle says concerning
himself,) <i>the chief of sinners,</i> 1 Tim. i. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am sensible that many will be ready to conclude, that much
of what has been said concerning sins to be confessed, is applicable
to none but those that are in a state of unregeneracy;
and, among them, few can say, that they are the chief of sinners,
unless they have been notoriously vile and scandalous in
the eye of the world; and that the apostle Paul, when he applies
this to himself, has a peculiar reference to what he was
before his conversion.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to this it may be replied; that it is impossible we should
know so much of the sins of others, together with their respective
aggravations, as we may of those that have been committed
by ourselves. And if we have not been left to commit
those gross and scandalous sins, which we have beheld in them
with abhorrence, this is not owing to ourselves, but the grace
of God, by which we are what we are; which, if we had been
destitute of, we should have been as bad as the worst of men;
and if our hearts have been renewed and changed thereby, so
that we are kept from committing those sins that are inconsistent
with a state of grace; yet there are very heinous aggravations
attending those we have reason to charge ourselves with;
whereby we have acted contrary to the experience we have had
of the efficacious influence of the Holy Spirit, and have been
guilty of very great ingratitude against him, that has laid us under
the highest obligations. Thus concerning confession of sin,
when drawing nigh to God in the duty of prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We are now to consider another part of prayer, namely,
that we are therein thankfully to acknowledge the mercies of
God: Thus the Psalmist says, <i>Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,
and into his courts with praise; be thankful unto him,
and bless his name,</i> Psal. c. 4. And elsewhere, <i>I will offer to
thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving; and will call upon the name of
the Lord,</i> Psal. cxvi. 17. that is, I will join prayer and praise
together. Nothing is more obvious, than that favours received
ought to be acknowledged; otherwise we are guilty of that
ingratitude which is one of the vilest crimes. Not to acknowledge
what we receive from God, is, in effect, to deny our obligation
to him; which will provoke him to withhold from us
those other mercies which we stand in need of.</p>

<p class='c006'>This duty ought to be performed at all times, and on all occasions:
Thus the apostle says, <i>In every thing by prayer and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>supplication with thanksgiving, let your request be made known
unto God,</i> Phil. iv. 6. This is evident, in that there is no condition
of life but what has some mixture of mercy in it; and that this
may be more particularly considered, we may observe, that the
mercies we receive from God, are either outward or spiritual,
common or special; the former of these he gives to all without
distinction; as it is said, <i>The Lord is good to all, and his
tender mercies are over all his works,</i> Psal. cxlv. 9. And elsewhere,
he is <i>kind unto the unthankful, and to the evil,</i> Luke vi.
35. <i>and maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust,</i> Matt. v. 45. The
latter sort of mercies he bestows on the heirs of salvation, in a
covenant-way, as the purchase of the blood of Christ, and a
pledge of farther blessings which he has reserved in store for
them: There are mercies which we have in hand, or in possession,
and others which we have in hope or in reversion: Thus
the apostle speaks of the <i>hope</i> which is <i>laid up for</i> the saints <i>in
heaven,</i> Col. i. 3, 5. which he <i>thanks</i> God for in his prayer for
the church.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, the mercies of God may be considered either as personal
or relative; the former we are more immediately the
subjects of; the latter affect us so far as we stand related to
others, for whose welfare we are greatly concerned, and whose
happiness makes a very considerable addition to our own.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] We are to express our thankfulness to God for personal
mercies; and accordingly we are to bless him for the advantages
of nature, which are the effects of divine goodness: Thus
the Psalmist says, <i>I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and
wonderfully made,</i> Psal. cxxxix. 14. Though the human nature
falls very short of what it was at first, when the image of
God was perfectly enstamped on all the powers and faculties
of the soul; and it is not what it shall be when brought to a
state of perfection in heaven: Yet there are many natural endowments
which we have received from God, as a means for
our glorifying him, and answering the end of our being, in the
whole conduct of our lives: And,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, As to what concerns the blessings of providence, which
we have received in every age of life. In our childhood and
youth we have great reason to be thankful, if we have had the
invaluable blessing of a religious education, and have been
kept or delivered from the pernicious influence of bad examples,
from whence that age of life oftentimes receives such
a tincture as tends to vitiate the soul, and open the way for
all manner of sin, which will afterwards insinuate itself into,
and prevail, like an infectious distemper, over all the powers
and faculties thereof. What reason have we to bless God if
we have been favoured with restraining or preventing grace,
whereby we have been kept from youthful lusts, which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>destructive to multitudes, and lay a foundation for their future
ruin; and especially if it has pleased God to bring us under
early convictions of sin; so that we have experienced in that
age of life, the hopeful beginnings of a work of grace, which
is an effect of more than common providence! We ought to
take notice, with great thankfulness, of the methods of divine
grace, if we have been early led into the knowledge of the first
principles of the oracles of God, especially if they have made
such an impression on our hearts, that we can say, with
good Obadiah, <i>I thy servant, fear the Lord from my youth,</i>
1 Kings xviii. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, we are to express our thankfulness for the mercies
which we have received in our advanced age, when arrived to
a state of manhood; and accordingly are to bless him for directing
and ordering our settlement in the world, in those
things more especially that relate to our secular callings and
employments therein, and the advantages of suitable society in
those families in which our lot has been cast, as well as the
many instances of divine goodness in our own. We ought
also to bless him for succeeding our industry and endeavours
used, to promote our comfort and happiness in the world, together
with that degree of usefulness which it has pleased God
to favour us with, therein. We ought also to bless him for
carrying us through many difficulties that lay in our way, some
of which we have been almost ready to think insurmountable;
as also for bringing us under the means of grace, in which the
providence of God is more remarkable, in those who have not
been favoured with a religious education in their childhood;
and more especially if these means have been made effectual
to answer the highest and most valuable ends.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are other mercies which some have reason to bless
God for, who are arrived to old age, which is the last stage of
life, wherein the frame of nature is declining and hastening
apace to a dissolution. These, I say, have reason to be thankful,
if they have not, as it were, outlived themselves, wholly
lost their memory and judgment, by which means they would
have been brought back again, as it were, to the state of childhood,
as some have been; or, if old age be not pressed down
beyond measure, with pain and bodily diseases, or a multitude
of cares and troubles about outward circumstances in the world,
which would tend to embitter the small remains of life, which
has not much strength of nature to bear up under great troubles,
nor can those methods be made use of, whereby others, without
much difficulty, are able to extricate themselves out of
them: But they, of all others, have most reason to bless God,
who can look back on a long series of usefulness, in proportion
to the number of years they have lived; so that that promise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>is fulfilled to them, <i>They shall still bring forth fruit in old
age; they shall be fat and flourishing</i>, Psal. xcii. 14. This is
more than a common mercy, and therefore requires a greater
degree of thankfulness, when it may be said of them, <i>The
hoary head is a crown of glory, being found in the way of
righteousness</i>, Prov. xvi. 31. and grace keeps equal pace with
age; and they have nothing to do but to wait for a release,
from a careful, vain, uneasy life to heaven. Thus concerning
the occasions we have for thankfulness in every age of life.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, We are now to consider the reason that we have to be
thankful in the various circumstances or conditions of life;
particularly,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, When we have a great measure of outward prosperity,
which is more than many enjoy; which calls for a proportionable
degree of thankfulness, especially if it be sanctified and
sweetened with a sense of God’s special love, so that it is a
pledge and earnest of better things reserved for us hereafter.
When we have the good things of this life for our conveniency,
that our passage through the world may be more easy and comfortable
to us; and yet we have ground to hope that this is not
our portion, or that we are not like those whom the Psalmist
speaks of, and calls <i>the men of the world, who have their portion
in this life</i>, Psal. xvii. 14. or, like the rich man in the
parable, to whom it was said, <i>Son, remember that thou in thy
life-time receivedst thy good things</i>, Luke xvi. 25. We have
reason to bless God when outward prosperity is a means of
our glorifying him, and being more serviceable to promote his
interest, and not a snare or occasion of sin, when it is not like
the <i>prosperity of fools</i>, which has a tendency to <i>destroy them</i>,
Prov. i. 32. or when what is said concerning that murmuring
generation of men, whom the Psalmist speaks of, that <i>lusted
exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert</i>:
so that though <i>he gave them their request, he sent leanness into
their soul</i>, is not applicable to us, Psal. cvi. 14, 15. Again,
when we enjoy the outward blessings of providence, and, at
the same time, live above them; so that our hearts are not too
much set upon them; but we are willing to part with them,
when God is about to deprive us of them, or take us from
them; and when outward enjoyments are helps, and not hindrances
to us in our way to heaven. These are inducements
to the greatest thankfulness, and ought to be acknowledged to
the glory of God.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, We have reason to be thankful, though it pleases God
to follow us with many afflictions and adverse providences in
the world: These are not, indeed, to be reckoned blessings in
themselves; nevertheless, they are not inconsistent with a thankful
frame of spirit; especially,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span><i>1st</i>, When we take occasion from hence to be affected with
the vanity, emptiness, and uncertainty of all outward comforts,
which perish in the using.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, When afflictive providences have a tendency to humble
and make us submissive to the divine will, so that we are
hereby led to have a deep sense of sin, the procuring cause
thereof. Thus Ephraim speaks of his being chastised by God,
and, at the same time, <i>ashamed and confounded</i>, as <i>bearing the
reproach</i> of former sins committed by him, Jer. xxxi. 18, 19.
or, when those sins, which before prevailed, are hereby prevented,
and we enabled to mortify them: Thus the Psalmist
says, <i>Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now I have kept
thy word</i>, Psal. cxix. 67. And when God is pleased to cause
his grace to abound as outward troubles abound. 2 Cor. iv. 16.
and when the want of outward mercies makes us see the worth
of them, and puts us upon improving every instance of the
divine goodness, as a great inducement to thankfulness.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, We have reason to be thankful under afflictions, when
we have a comfortable hope that they are evidences of our being
God’s children, interested in his special love, Heb. xii. 7. so
that we have ground to conclude, that he is hereby training us
up, and making us more meet for the heavenly inheritance, so
that we can say with the apostle, <i>Our light affliction, which is
but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and
eternal weight of glory</i>, 2 Cor. iv. 17.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] We are to express our thankfulness for those mercies
which we call relative, or for the blessings that others enjoy,
in whose welfare we are more immediately concerned. As it
is the duty of every one to desire the good of all men; so we
ought to bless God for the mercies bestowed on others as well
as ourselves. The relation we stand in to others, is either more
general or extensive, and, in this respect, it may include in it
all mankind; and accordingly we are to be thankful for the
mercies which our fellow-creatures receive from the hand of
God, inasmuch as hereby the divine perfections are magnified:
And, as for those who receive the blessings that accompany
salvation, the ends of Christ’s death, and the dispensation of
the gospel, are hereby attained; and whatever mercies God
bestows on others, we bless him for them, as taking encouragement
to hope that he will bestow the same blessings upon us,
when we stand in need of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for those who are related to us in the bonds of nature, or
as members of the family to which we belong, for whose welfare
we are more immediately concerned, we may, in some
measure, reckon the mercies they enjoy, our own, and
therefore should be induced to bless God, and be thankful for
them, as well as for those which we receive in our persons.—There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>is also another relation, which is more large and extensive,
namely, that which we stand in to all the members of
Christ’s mystical body, whom the apostle calls <i>the household of
faith</i>, Gal. vi. 10. and, as such, supposes them to be entitled to
our more special regard: Accordingly we are to express our
thankfulness to God, in prayer, for all the mercies they receive,
especially those that are of a spiritual nature; inasmuch as
herein Christ is glorified, and his interest advanced, which
ought to be dearer to us than any thing that relates to our own
private or personal interest, as the Psalmist speaks of his preferring
Jerusalem’s welfare above <i>his chief joy</i>, Psal. cxxxvii. 6.
And that which farther inclines us to do this, is, because we
hope that we shall be made partakers of the same blessings,
whereby others will have occasion to bless God on our behalf.
Thus concerning the inducements we have to thankfulness for
blessings received, either by ourselves or others.</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall conclude this head by considering, that thankfulness,
which ought to be a great ingredient in prayer, is always to be
accompanied with the exercise of other graces, whereby we
are disposed to adore and magnify the divine perfections that
are displayed in the distribution of those favours which we
bless him for; together with an humble sense of our own unworthiness
of the least of those mercies which we enjoy, and an
earnest desire that we may be enabled, not only to do this in
words, but to express our thankfulness to him by such a frame
of spirit as is agreeable thereto.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are two things more, contained in the answer we
have been explaining, without the due consideration whereof,
the duty of prayer would be very imperfectly handled, namely,
its being an offering up of our desires to God in the name
of Christ, and by the help of the Spirit: But since these are
particularly insisted on in some following answers, I have purposely
waved the consideration of them at present.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXXIX., CLXXX., CLXXXI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXIX.</span> <i>Are we to pray unto God only?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> God only being able to search the hearts, hear the
requests, pardon the sins, and only to be believed in, and
worshipped with religious worship, prayer, which is a special
part thereof, is to be made by all to him alone, and to none
other.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXX.</span> <i>What is it to pray the name of Christ?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> To pray in the name of Christ is in obedience to his
command, and in confidence on his promises to ask mercy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>for his sake, not by bare mentioning of his name, but by
drawing our encouragement to pray, and our boldness,
strength, and hope of acceptance in prayer, from Christ and
his mediation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXXI.</span> <i>Why are we to pray in the name of Christ?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The sinfulness of man, and his distance from God by
reason thereof, being so great as that we can have no access
into his presence without a Mediator; and there being none
in heaven or earth appointed to, or fit for that glorious
work, but Christ alone; we are to pray in no other name
but his only.</p>

<p class='c011'>In these answers we have a farther explication of what is
briefly laid down in the last; and that, more especially, as
to what respects the object of prayer; and the method prescribed
in the gospel, relating to our drawing nigh to God,
through a mediator, which is called praying in the name of
Christ; together with the reason hereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. It is observed, that prayer is to be made to God alone,
and to none other. This appears,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Because it is an act of religious worship, which is due to
none but God; as our Saviour says, <i>Thou shalt worship the
Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve</i>, Matt. iv. 10.—This
can be denied by none who are, in any measure, acquainted
either with natural or revealed religion; in which we are
obliged to extol, adore, and admire those divine perfections
which are displayed in the works of nature and grace, and to
seek that help from him, and those supplies of grace that we
stand in need of to make us completely blessed, which supposes
him to be infinitely perfect and all-sufficient. Now to
ascribe this divine glory to a creature, either directly, or by
consequence, is, in effect, to say that he is equal with God,
and thereby to rob him of that glory that is due to him alone,
to seek that from the creature, that none but God can give, or
to ascribe any of the perfections of the divine nature to it, is
the highest affront that can be offered to the divine Majesty.
Now as prayer without adoration and invocation, is destitute
of those ingredients which render it an act of religious worship;
so to address ourselves, in such a way, to any one but
God, is an instance of such profaneness and idolatry, as is not
to be mentioned without the greatest detestation.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Prayer is to be made only to God, inasmuch as he only
is able to search the heart, which is a glory peculiar to himself,
in which he is distinguished from all creatures, 1 Kings viii. 39.
Acts i. 24. It is the heart that is principally to be regarded in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>prayer: If this be not right with God, there is no glory that
we can ascribe to him, that will be reckoned any better than
<i>flattering him with our mouth</i>, and <i>lying to him with our
tongues</i>, Psal. lxxviii. 36, 37. as the Psalmist says: Therefore,
the inward frame of our spirit, and the principle, or spring
from whence all religious duties proceed, being only known
to God, prayer is only to be directed to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. He alone can hear our requests, pardon our sins, and
fulfil our desires. Prayer, when addressed to God, is not like
that in which we desire those favours from men, which are of
a lower nature, whereby some particular wants are supplied,
in those respects in which one creature may be of advantage
to another; but when we pray to God, we seek those blessings
which are the effects of infinite power and goodness, such as
may make us completely happy, both in this and a better
world. Moreover, we are to implore forgiveness of sin from
him in prayer; which is a blessing none can bestow but God,
Mark ii. 7. for as his law is the rule by which the goodness or
badness of actions are determined; and the threatening which
he has annexed to it, is that which renders us liable to that
punishment sin deserves; so it is he alone that can remit the
debt of punishment, which we are liable to, and give us a right
and title to forfeited blessings; which being the principal thing
that we are to seek for in prayer, this argues that none but God
is the object thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. God alone is to be believed in: Accordingly prayer, if
it be acceptable to him, must be performed by faith. Thus
the apostle says, <i>How shall they call on him, in whom they have
not believed?</i> Rom. x. 14. There must be a firm persuasion
that he can grant us the blessings we ask for; herein faith addresses
itself to him as God all-sufficient; and is persuaded that
he will fulfil all his promises, as a God of infinite faithfulness;
and accordingly we are to give up ourselves entirely to him as
our proprietor and bountiful benefactor, the only fountain of
blessedness, and object of religious worship: This is to be done
by faith in prayer, and consequently it is to be directed to God
only.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We are now to consider what it is to pray in the name of
Christ: This doth not consist barely in a mentioning his name;
which many do when they ask for favours for his sake, without
a due regard to the method God has ordained; in which we
are to draw nigh to him by Christ our great Mediator, who
is to be glorified as the person by whom we are to have access
to God the Father as the fountain of all the blessings, which
are communicated to us in this method of divine grace. To
come to God in Christ’s name, includes in it the whole work
of faith, as to what it has to plead with, or hope for, from him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>through a Mediator, in that way which he has prescribed to
us in the gospel. And this more especially consists in our
making a right use of what Christ has done and suffered for
us, as the foundation of our hope, that God will be pleased to
grant us what he has purchased thereby; which contains the
sum of all that we can desire, when drawing nigh to him in
prayer. Here let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That the thoughts of having to do with an absolute God,
cannot but fill us with the utmost distress and confusion, when
we consider ourselves as guilty sinners, and God, out of Christ,
as a sin-revenging Judge, a consuming fire, Heb. xii. 29. in
which case we may well say, as our first parent did, immediately
after his fall, <i>I heard thy voice and I was afraid</i>, Gen.
iii. 10.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. God is obliged, in honour, as a God of infinite holiness,
to separate and banish sinners from his comfortable presence,
they being liable to the curse and condemning sentence of the
law; by reason whereof his terror makes them afraid, and his
dread falls upon them; nevertheless,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. They have, in the gospel, not only an invitation to come,
but a discovery of that great Mediator, whom God has ordained
to conduct his people into his presence, having procured
liberty of access to him, or, as the apostle expresses it, <i>boldness
to enter into the holiest by his blood, by a new and living
way, which he has consecrated for us through the vail, that is
to say, his flesh</i>, Heb. x. 19, 20. and he has, for this end,
erected a throne of grace, and encouraged us to come to it,
and given many great and precious promises, whereby we may
hope for acceptance in his sight; these being all established in
Christ, and the blessings contained therein procured by his
blood, and having liberty, in coming, to plead what he has
done and suffered, as what was designed to be the foundation
of our hope of obtaining mercy, we are said to come and make
our supplications to God in the name of Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We are now to consider the reason why we are to pray
in the name of Christ; and that we have in one of the answers
we are explaining. In which it is observed; that man, by sin,
is set at such a distance from God, that he cannot, by any
means, come into his presence. God cannot look upon him
with any delight or complacency; inasmuch as his guilt renders
him the object of his abhorrence; and he cannot do any
thing which has a tendency to reconcile God to him, and therefore
he is speechless, and can ask for no blessing at his hand.
And it is farther observed, that there is none in heaven or
earth, that is, no mere creature, that is fit for that glorious
work; none has a sufficiency of merit to present to God,
whereby he may be said to make atonement for sin; or, as Job
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>expresses it, there is <i>no days-man that might lay his hand on
both</i> parties, Job ix. 33. that is, able to deal with God in paying
a ransom; which he may, in honour accept of; or with
man, by encouraging him to hope that he shall obtain the
blessings which he stands in need of; and bringing him into
such a frame, that he may draw nigh to God in a right manner.
This is only owing to our Lord Jesus Christ; and he does it
as our great Mediator, who alone is fit to manage this important
work; therefore we are to pray to God, only in his
name, who is, by divine appointment, an advocate with the Father,
pleading our cause before his throne, and thereby giving
us ground of encouragement, that our persons shall be accepted,
and our prayers answered upon his account, who is
the only Mediator of redemption and intercession, in whom
God is well pleased, and gives a believer ground to conclude
that he shall not seek his face in vain.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXXXII., CLXXXIII., CLXXXIV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXXII.</span> <i>How doth the Spirit help us to pray?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> We not knowing what to pray for as we ought, the
Spirit helpeth our infirmities, by enabling us to understand
both for whom, and what, and how prayer is to be made,
and by working and quickening in our hearts (although not
in all persons, not at all times in the same measure) those
apprehensions, affections, and graces, which are requisite
for the right performance of that duty.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXXIII.</span> <i>For whom are we to pray?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> We are to pray for the whole church of Christ, upon
earth, for magistrates and ministers, for ourselves, our brethren,
yea, our enemies, and for all sorts of men living, or
that shall live hereafter, but not for the dead, nor for those
that are known to have sinned the sin unto death.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXXIV.</span> <i>For what things are we to pray?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> We are to pray for all things tending to the glory of
God, the welfare of the church, our own, or other’s good, but
not for any thing that is unlawful.</p>

<p class='c011'>As there is no duty that we can perform in a right manner,
without help obtained from God—And the same may be
said, in particular, concerning that of prayer: Accordingly we
are led,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. To speak of the help that the Spirit of God is pleased to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>afford believers, in order to their engaging aright in this duty.
Here we may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That it is supposed that we know not what to pray for as
we ought, or how to bring our souls into a prepared frame for
this duty, without the Spirit’s assistance.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) We are oftentimes at a loss with respect to the matter
of prayer; and this may be said to proceed from our being
unacquainted with ourselves, and not duly sensible of our
wants, weaknesses, or secret faults: Sometimes we cannot determine
whether we are in a state of grace or no; or, if we are,
whether it is increasing or declining; or, if we have ground to
complain by reason of the hidings of God’s face, and our want
of communion with him, we are oftentimes hard put to it to find
out what is that secret sin which is the occasion of it; nor are we
sufficiently apprized of the wiles of Satan, or the danger we
are in of being ensnared or overcome thereby. Moreover, we
are oftentimes not able to know how to direct our prayers to
God aright, as we know not what is most conducive to his
glory, or what it is that he requires of us, either in obedience
to his commanding will, or in submission to his providential
will. Hence it arises, that many good men, in scripture, have
asked for some things which have been in themselves unlawful,
through the weakness of their faith, and the prevalency of
their corruption: Thus some have desired, that God would
call them out of this world by death, being impatient under
the many troubles they met with therein; accordingly we read
concerning Elijah, that ‘he requested for himself that he might
die, and said, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my
life; for I am not better than my fathers,’ 1 Kings xix. 4.
and Job says, ‘O that I might have my request! and that God
would grant me the thing that I long for! Even that it would
please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand,
and cut me off,’ Job vi. 8, 9. And Jonah says, ‘O Lord, I
beseech thee, take my life from me; for it is better for me to
die than to live,’ Jonah iv. 3. And Moses, though he had
the character of the meekest man upon earth, and doubtless
excelled all others in his day, in those graces which he had
received from God, as well as in the great honours conferred
on him; yet he puts up a most unbecoming prayer, both as to
the matter and manner thereof; as it is observed, that he said
unto the Lord, ‘Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant?
and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou
layest the burden of all this people upon me? Have I conceived
all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest
say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom (as a nursing-father
beareth the sucking child) unto the land which thou
swarest unto their fathers? Whence should I have flesh to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying,
Give us flesh, that we may eat. I am not able to bear all this
people alone, because it is too heavy for me. And if thou deal
thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have
found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness,’
Numb. xi. 11-15. And, in another instance, he asks
for a thing which he knew before hand, that God would not
grant him, when he says, ‘I pray thee, let me go over and see
the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain,
and Lebanon:’ Upon which God says, ‘Let it suffice thee,
speak no more unto me of this matter,’ Deut. iii. 25, 26.—Many
instances of the like nature are mentioned in scripture;
and, indeed, nothing is more obvious from daily experience,
that what the apostle James observes, that persons ‘ask and
receive not, because they ask amiss,’ James iv. 3. or what the
apostle Paul says, ‘We know not what we should pray for as
we ought,’ Rom. viii. 26.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We are, at other times, straitened in our affections,
and so know not how to ask any thing with a suitable frame of
spirit: It is certain we cannot excite our affections, or especially
put forth those graces which are to be exercised in
prayer, when we please. Our hearts are sometimes dead,
cold, and inclined to wander from God in this duty; and, at
other times, we pray with a kind of indifferency, as though it
was of no great importance whether our prayer were answered
or no. How seldom do we express that importunity in this
duty which Jacob did, ‘I will not let thee go, except thou
bless me?’ Gen. xxxii. 26. And as for those graces that are
to be exercised in prayer, we often want that reverence, and
those high and awful thoughts of the divine Majesty, which
we ought to have, who draw nigh to a God of infinite perfection;
nor, on the other hand, do we express those low and
humble thoughts of ourselves, as our own meanness, the imperfection
of our best performances, and the infinite distance
which we stand at from God, ought to suggest; and to this
we may add, that we are often destitute of that love to Christ,
and trust in him, which are necessary to the right performance
of this duty, as also of that hope of being heard, which is a
very great encouragement to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are now to enquire wherein the Spirit is said to help
our infirmities; and this may be considered as adapted to that
two-fold necessity which we are often under, respecting the
matter or frame of spirit with which this duty is to be performed.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) The Spirit helps our infirmities, with respect to the
matter of prayer. This is not in the least derogatory to his
divine glory, if he is pleased to condescend thus to converse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>with man, and it is not contrary to the nature of things; for
the Spirit, being a divine Person, searches the heart, and can
impress those ideas on the souls of his people, whereby they
may be led into the knowledge of those things that they ought
to ask in prayer, with as much facility as any one can convey
his ideas to another by words. If it was impossible for God
to do this, his providence could not be conversant about intelligent
creatures, any otherwise than in an objective way, in
which it would not differ from that which may be attributed to
finite spirits. And it would have been impossible for God to
have imparted his mind and will by extraordinary revelation,
(without which, it could not have been known) if he may not,
though it be in an ordinary way, communicate those ideas to
the souls of his people, whereby they may be furnished with
matter for prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am not pleading for extraordinary revelation; for that is to
expect a blessing that God does not now give to his people:
But I only argue from the greater to the less; whereby it
may appear, that it is not impossible, or absurd, from the nature
of the thing, or contrary to the divine perfections, for God
to impress the thoughts of men in an ordinary way; since he
formerly did this in an extraordinary, as will be allowed by
all, who are not disposed to deny and set aside revealed religion.
Moreover, there was such a thing in the apostle’s days,
as being led by the Spirit, which was distinguished from his
miraculous and extraordinary influences, as a Spirit of inspiration;
otherwise, it is certain, he would not have assigned this
as a character of the children of God, which he does, Rom.
viii. 14. And when our Saviour promises his people the <i>Spirit
to guide them into all truth</i>, John xvi. 13. I cannot think that
this only respected the apostles, or their being led into the
truths that they were to impart to the church by divine inspiration;
but it seems to be a privilege that belongs to all believers:
Therefore, we conclude, that it is no absurdity to
suppose that he may assist his people, as to what concerns the
matter of their prayers, or suggest to them those becoming
thoughts which they have in prayer, when drawing nigh to
God in a right manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some have enquired, whether we may conclude that the
Spirit of God furnishes his people with words in prayer, distinct
from his impressing ideas on their minds? This I would
be very cautious in determining, lest I should hereby not put
a just difference between this assistance of the Spirit, that believers
hope for, and that which the prophets of old received
by inspiration. I dare not say, that the Spirit’s work consists
in furnishing believers with proper expressions, with which
their ideas are clothed, when they engage in this duty, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>rather with those suitable arguments and apprehensions of
divine things, which are more immediately subservient thereunto:
Accordingly the apostle, speaking of the Spirit’s assisting
believers, when they know not what to pray for as they
ought, says, that he does this <i>with groanings that cannot be
uttered</i>: that is, he impresses on their souls those divine
breathings after things spiritual and heavenly, which they
sometimes, notwithstanding, want words to express; though,
at the same time, the frame of their spirits may be under a
divine influence, which God is said to know the meaning of,
when he graciously hears and answers their prayers, how imperfect
soever they may be, as to the mode of expression.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The Spirit helps our infirmities by giving us a suitable
frame of spirit, and exciting those graces which are to be exercised
in this duty of prayer. This the Psalmist calls, <i>preparing
their hearts</i>; which God does, and then <i>causes his ear
to hear</i>, Psal. x. 17. which is a very desirable blessing; and,
in order to our understanding it aright, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That we cannot, without the Spirit’s assistance, bring
our hearts into a right frame for prayer; and that is the reason
why we engage in this duty, in such a manner as gives
great uneasiness to us when we reflect upon it; so that when
we pretend to draw nigh to God, we can hardly say that we
worship him as God, but become vain in our imaginations;
and the corruption of our nature discovers itself more at this
time than it does on other occasions; and Satan uses his utmost
endeavours to distract and disturb our thoughts, and take
off the edge of our affections; whereby we seem not really to
desire those things which, with our lips, we ask at the hand
of God. As for an unregenerate man, he has not a principle
of grace, and therefore cannot pray in faith, or with the exercise
of those other graces which he is destitute of; and the believer
is renewed but in part, and therefore, if the Spirit is
not pleased to excite the principle of grace which he has implanted,
he is very much indisposed for this duty, which cannot
be performed aright without his assistance.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] We are, nevertheless, to use our utmost endeavours, in
order thereunto, hoping for a blessing from God to succeed
them. Accordingly, we are to meditate on the divine perfections,
and the evil of sin, which is contrary thereunto; whereby
we are rendered guilty, defiled, and unworthy to come into
the presence of God; yet we consider ourselves as invited to
come to him in the gospel, and encouraged by his promise
and grace, to cast ourselves before his footstool, in hope of obtaining
mercy from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are also to examine ourselves, that we may know what
sins are to be confessed by us, and what are those necessities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>which will afford matter for petition or supplication in prayer,
together with the mercies we have received; which are to be
thankfully acknowledged therein. We are also to consider
the many encouragements which we have, to draw nigh to God
in this duty, taken from his being ready to pardon our iniquities,
heal our backslidings, help our infirmities, and grant us
undeserved favours. We must also impress on our souls a
due sense of the spirituality of the duty we are to engage in,
and that we have to do with the heart-searching God, who will
be worshipped with reverence and holy fear; and therefore
we are to endeavour to excite all the powers and faculties of
our souls, to engage in this duty in such a way that we may
hereby glorify his name, and hope to receive a gracious answer
from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] When we have used our utmost endeavours to bring
ourselves into a praying frame, yet we must depend on the
Holy Spirit to give success thereunto, that we may be enabled
to exercise those graces that are more especially his gift and
work: And, in order thereunto,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, We must give glory to him as the author of regeneration,
since no grace can be exercised in this duty but what
proceeds from a right principle, or a nature renewed, and internally
sanctified, and disposed for the performance hereof;
which is his work, as the <i>Spirit of grace and of supplication</i>,
Zech. xii. 10.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, As we are to draw nigh to God in this duty, as a reconciled
God and Father, if we hope to be accepted by him;
so we are to consider, that this is the peculiar work of the Spirit,
whereby we are <i>enabled to cry, Abba, Father</i>, Rom. viii. 15.
Gal. iv. 6. This will not only dispose us to perform this duty
in a right manner, so as to enable us to pray in faith; but it
will afford us ground of hope that our prayers will be heard
and answered by him.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Inasmuch as we often are straitened in our spirits,
which is a great hindrance to us in this duty, we must consider
it as a peculiar blessing and gift of the Holy Ghost, to have
our hearts enlarged; which the Psalmist intends, when he says,
<i>Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name</i>, Psal.
cxlii. 7. and it is a peculiar branch of that liberty which he is
pleased to bestow on his people, under the gospel-dispensation;
as the apostle says, <i>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty</i>,
2 Cor. iii. 17. And by this means our affections will be
raised, and we enabled to pour out our souls before him.</p>

<p class='c006'>This may give us occasion to enquire concerning the difference
that there is between raised affections in prayer, which
unregenerate persons sometimes have, from external motives;
and those which the Spirit excites in us as a peculiar blessing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>whereby he assists us in the discharge of this duty. There are
several things in which they differ; as,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, The former of these oftentimes proceeds from a slavish
fear and dread of the wrath of God; the latter from a love to,
and desire after him, which arises from the view we have of
his glory, as our covenant God, in and through a Mediator.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, Raised affections in unregenerate persons, are seldom
found, but when they are under some pressing affliction, in
which case, as the prophet says, <i>They will seek God early</i>, Hos.
v. 15. but when this is removed, the affections grow stupid,
cold, and indifferent, as they were before his afflicting hand
was laid upon them: Whereas, on the other hand, a believer
will find his heart drawn forth after God and divine things,
when he is not sensible of any extraordinary affliction that
gives vent to his passions; or he finds, that as afflictions tend
to excite some graces in the exercise whereof his affections are
moved, so when it pleases God to deliver him from them, his
affections are still raised while other graces are exercised
agreeably thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Raised affections, in unregenerate men, for the most
part, carry them forth in the pursuit of those temporal blessings
which they stand in need of: Thus when Esau sought
the blessing carefully with tears, it was that outward prosperity
which was contained therein, that he had principally in
view, as disdaining that his brother Jacob should be preferred
before him; or, as it is said, <i>made his Lord, and his brethren
given him for servants</i>, Gen. xxvii. 37. but he had no regard
to the spiritual or saving blessings contained therein: Whereas,
a believer is most concerned for, and affected with those
blessings that immediately accompany salvation, or contain in
them the special love of God, or communion with him, which
he prefers to all other things: Thus the Psalmist says, <i>There
be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou
up the light of thy countenance upon us</i>, Psal. iv. 6. And to
this we may add,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, Whatever raised affections unregenerate persons may
have, they want a broken heart, an humble sense of sin, and
an earnest desire that it may be subdued and mortified; they
are destitute of self-denial, and other graces of the like nature,
which, in some degree, are found in a believer, when assisted
by the Spirit, in performing the duty of prayer in a right
manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>From what has been said concerning the Spirit’s assistance
in prayer, we may infer,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That there is a great difference between the gift and the
grace of prayer: The former may be attained by the improvement
of our natural abilities, and is oftentimes of use to others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>who join with us therein; whereas the latter is a peculiar
blessing from the Spirit of God, and an evidence of the truth
of grace.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, They who deny that the Spirit has any hand in the
work of grace, and consequently disown his assistance in
prayer, cannot be said to give him that glory that is due to
him, and therefore must be supposed to be destitute of his
assistance, and very deficient as to this duty.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Let us not presume on the Spirit’s assistance in prayer,
while we continue in a course of grieving him, and quenching
his holy motions.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, Let us desire raised affections, as a great blessing
from God, and yet not be discouraged from engaging in prayer,
though we want them; since this grace, as well as all
others, is dispensed in a way of sovereignty: And if he is
pleased, for wise ends, to withhold his assistance; yet we
must not say, why should I wait on the Lord any longer?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>5thly</i>, If we would pray in the Spirit, or experience his help,
to perform this duty in a right manner, let us endeavour to
walk in the Spirit, and to maintain a spiritual, holy, self-denying
frame, at all times, if we would not be destitute of it,
when we engage in this duty. This leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. The persons for whom we are to pray; and on the other
hand, who are not to be prayed for.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As to the former of those: It is observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That we are to pray for the whole church of Christ
upon earth; by which we are to understand, all those that profess
the faith of the gospel, especially such whose practice is
agreeable to their profession; and in particular, all those religious
societies who consent to walk in those ordinances whereby
they testify their subjection to Christ, as king of saints.
The particular members of which these societies consist, are,
for the most part, unknown to us; so that we cannot pray for
them by name, or as being acquainted with the condition and
circumstances in which they are; yet they are not to be wholly
disregarded, or excluded from the benefit of our prayers:
Thus the apostle speaks of the <i>great conflict he had</i>, not only
<i>for them at Laodicea; but, for as many as had not seen his face
in the flesh</i>, Col. ii. 1. This is a peculiar branch of the communion
of saints, and it is accompanied with those earnest desires
which we have, that God may be glorified in them,
and by them, as well as ourselves; particularly we are to
pray,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That they may be united together in love to God and
to one another, John xvii. 21. That this may be attended with
all those other graces and comforts which are an evidence
of their interest in Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>[2.] That they may have the special presence of God with
them in all his ordinances, which will be a visible testimony
of his regard to them, and an honour put on his own institutions,
as well as an accomplishment of what he promised to
his apostles just before he ascended into heaven, that he
would <i>be with them always even unto the end of the world</i>,
Mat. xxviii. 20.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] That they may be supported under the burdens, difficulties
and persecutions which they meet with, either from the
powers of darkness or wicked men, for Christ’s sake, that so
the promise may be made good to them, that <i>the gates of hell
shall not prevail against them</i>, chap. xvi. 18.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] That there may be added to particular churches out of the
world, many such as shall be saved, Acts ii. 47. which shall be
an argument of the success of the gospel: And when we pray,
that God would magnify his grace in bringing sinners home
to himself, we are to pray for the accomplishment of those promises
that respect the conversion of the Jews: Thus the apostle
says, <i>Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel
is, that they might be saved</i>, Rom. x. 1. and, that there
may be a greater spread of the gospel throughout the most remote
and dark parts of the earth, among whom Christ is,
at present, unknown: This the apostle calls <i>The fulness of
the Gentiles coming in</i>, chap. xi. 25. and it is agreeable to
what is foretold by the prophet Isaiah, in chap. lx. which
seems not as yet to have had its full accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] We are to pray that the life of faith and holiness may
be daily promoted in all the faithful members of the church
of Christ, that they may be enabled more and more to adorn
the doctrine of God, our Saviour, and be abundantly satisfied,
and delighted with the fruits and effects of his redeeming
love.</p>

<p class='c006'>[6.] That God would accept of those sacrifices of prayer
and praise that are daily offered to him by faith, in the blood
of Christ, in every worshipping assembly, which will redound
to the advantage of all the servants of Christ, whom they
think themselves obliged to make mention of in their prayers,
as well as to the glory of God, which is owned and advanced
thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>[7.] That the children of believers, who are devoted to God,
may be under his special care and protection, that they may
follow the footsteps of the flock, and fill up the places of those
who are called off the stage of this world; that so there may
be a constant supply of those who shall bear a testimony to
Christ and his gospel in the rising generation.</p>

<p class='c006'>[8.] That the members of every particular church of Christ
may acquit themselves so as that they may honour him in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>eyes of the world, and be supported and carried safely through
this waste howling wilderness, till they arrive at that better
country for which they are bound; and that they may not
be foiled or overcome while they are in their militant state,
but may be joined with the church triumphant in heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We are to pray for magistrates. This is not only included
in the general exhortation given us to <i>pray for all men</i>;
but they are particularly mentioned by the apostle, and it is
intimated that it is <i>good and acceptable in the sight of God our
Saviour,</i> 1 Tim. ii. 1-3. This also may be argued from hence,
that magistracy is God’s ordinance, Rom. xiii. 1, 2. and there
is no ordinance which is enstamped with the divine authority,
though it may principally respect civil affairs; but we are to
pray that God would succeed and prosper it, that it may answer
the valuable ends for which it was appointed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now there are several things that we are to pray for in
the behalf of magistrates, <i>viz.</i> that they may approve themselves
rulers after God’s own heart, to <i>fulfil all his will,</i> Acts
xii. 26. as was said of David; that their counsels and conduct
may be ordered for his glory, and the good of his church;
that they may not be a <i>terror</i> to good <i>works;</i> namely, to persons
that perform them, but <i>to the evil</i>; and so <i>may not bear
the sword in vain,</i> Rom. xiii. 3, 4. Accordingly we are to pray,
that they may be a public blessing to all their subjects, and
herein that promise may be fulfilled; <i>Kings shall be thy
nursing-fathers, and their queens thy nursing-mothers,</i> Isa.
xlix. 23. and, as an instance hereof, that under them <i>we may
lead a quiet and peaceable life, godliness and honesty,</i> 1
Tim. ii. 2. And, as to what concerns their subjects, that their
authority may not be abused and trampled on by them, on the
one hand, while they take occasion to offend with impunity;
nor be dreaded as grievous to others who feel the weight thereof,
in instances of injustice and oppression.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) We are to pray for ministers. This is a necessary duty,
inasmuch as their work is exceeding great and difficult; so that
the apostle might well say, <i>Who is sufficient for these things,</i>
2 Cor. ii. 16. And, indeed, besides the difficulties that attend
the work itself, there are others that they meet with, arising
from the unstable temper of professed friends, who sometimes,
as the apostle says, <i>become their enemies for telling them the
truth,</i> Gal. iv. 16. or from the restless malice and violent opposition
of open enemies; which evidently takes its rise from
that inveterate hatred that they bear to Christ and his gospel.
Moreover, as they have difficulties in the discharge of the
work they are called to, so they must give an account to
God for their faithfulness therein; and it is of the highest
importance that they do this <i>with joy, and not with grief,</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Heb. xiii. 17, 18. as the apostle speaks; and immediately he
intreats the church’s prayers, as that which was necessary in
order hereunto. Now there are several things which ought to
be the subject-matter of our prayers, with respect to ministers.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That God would send forth a supply or succession of
them, to answer the church’s necessities; inasmuch as <i>the harvest
is plenteous</i>, as our Saviour observes, <i>but the labourers are
few,</i> Matt. xi. 37, 38.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] That they may answer the character which the apostle
gives of a faithful minister; and accordingly <i>study to shew
themselves approved unto God, workmen that need not to be
ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth,</i> 2 Tim. ii. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] That they may be directed and enabled to impart those
truths that are substantial, edifying, and suitable to the circumstances
and condition of their hearers.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] That they may be spirited with zeal, and love to souls,
in the whole course of their ministry; that the glory of God,
and the advancement of his truth may lie nearest their hearts,
and a tender concern and compassion for the souls of men,
may incline them to use their utmost endeavours, as the apostle
speaks, <i>to save them with fear, pulling them out of the fire,</i>
Jude, ver. 23.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] That their endeavours may be attended with success,
which, in some measure, may give them a comfortable hope
that they are called, accepted, and approved of by God, which,
from the nature of the thing will tend to their own advantage,
who make this the subject of our earnest prayers on their
behalf; and, indeed, the neglect of performing this duty, may,
in some measure, be assigned as one reason why the word is
often preached with very little success; so that this ought to
be performed, not barely as an act of favour, but as a duty
that redounds to our own advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) We are to pray, not only for ourselves and our brethren,
but for our enemies. That we are to pray for ourselves,
none ever denied, how much so ever many live in the
neglect of this duty; and as for our obligation to pray for our
brethren, that is founded in the law of nature; which obliges
us to love them as ourselves, and, consequently, to desire their
welfare, together with our own.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, it may be enquired, what we are to understand by
our brethren, for whom we are to express this great concern
in our supplications to God? For the understanding of which,
let it be considered, that, besides those who are called <i>brethren</i>,
in the most known acceptation of the word, as Jacob’s
sons tell Joseph, <i>We be twelve brethren, sons of one father,</i> Gen.
xlii. 32. it is sometimes taken, in scripture, for any near kinsman:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Thus Abraham and Lot are called <i>brethren</i>, chap. xiii.
8. though they were not sons of the same father, for Lot was
Abraham’s brother’s son, chap. xi. 31. this is a very common
acceptation of the word in scripture. Again, it is sometimes
taken in a more large sense, for those who are members of the
same church: Thus the apostle calls those that belonged to
the church at Colosse, <i>the saints and faithful brethren in Christ,</i>
Col. i. 2. and sometimes they who are of the same nation, are
called brethren: Thus it is said, <i>When Moses was full forty
years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children,
of Israel,</i> Acts vii. 23. And it is sometimes taken for those
who make profession of the same religion with ourselves; and
also for those who are kind and friendly to us: Thus it is
said, <i>A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity,</i>
Prov. xvii. 17. and, indeed, the word is sometimes
taken in the largest sense that can be, as comprizing in it all
mankind, who have the same nature with ourselves, 1 John
iv. 21. These are objects of love, and therefore our prayers
are, especially in proportion to the nearness of the relation
they stand in to us, to be directed to God on their behalf.
Some, indeed, are allied to us by stronger bonds than others;
but none, who are entitled to our love, pity, and compassion,
are to be wholly excluded from our prayers.</p>

<p class='c006'>This will farther appear, if we consider that we are also to
pray for our enemies, as the law of nature obliges us to do
good for evil; and consequently, as our Saviour says, we are
to <i>pray for them which despitefully use us, and persecute us,</i>
Matt. v. 44. We are not, indeed, to pray for them, that they
may obtain their wicked and unjust designs against us; or that
they may have power and opportunity to hurt us; for that is
contrary to the principle of self-preservation, which is impressed
on our nature; but we are to pray for them.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That however they carry it to us they may be made
Christ’s friends, their hearts changed, and they enabled to
serve his interest; that they, together with ourselves, may be
partakers of everlasting salvation; therefore it is a vile thing,
and altogether inconsistent with the spirit of a christian, to desire
the ruin, much more the damnation of any one, as many
wickedly and profanely do.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] We are to pray that their corruptions may be subdued,
their tempers softened, and their hearts changed; so that they
may be sensible of, and lay aside their unjust resentments
against us. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] If they are under any distress or misery, we are not to
insult or take pleasure in beholding it, but to pity them, and
to pray for their deliverance, as much as though they were not
enemies to us.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>(5.) We are to pray not only for all sorts of men now living;
according to what is contained in the last head, but for
those that shall live hereafter. This includes in it an earnest
desire that the interest of Christ may be propagated from generation
to generation; and his kingdom and glory advanced
in the world until his second coming: Thus the Psalmist says,
<i>He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their
prayer: This shall be written for the generation to come; and
the people which shall be created, shall praise the Lord</i>, Psal. cii.
17, 18. and our Saviour says, <i>Neither pray I for these alone,
but for them also which shall believe on me through their word</i>,
John xvii, 20.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are now to consider those who are excluded from
our prayers; and these are either such as are dead, or those
who have sinned the sin unto death.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) We are not to pray for the dead. This is asserted in
opposition to what was maintained and practised by some in
the early ages of the church, and paved the way for those
abuses and corruptions which are practised by the church of
Rome, at this day, who first prayed for the dead, and afterwards
proceeded farther in praying for them. The first step
that was taken leading hereunto, seems to have been their being
guilty of great excesses in the large encomiums they made
in their public anniversary orations, in commemoration of the
martyrs and confessors, who had suffered in the cause of
christianity. This was done at first, with a good design, viz.
to excite those who survived, to imitate them in their virtues,
and to express their love to the cause for which they suffered;
but afterwards they went beyond the bounds of decency in
magnifying and extolling them; and then they proceeded yet
farther, in praying for them; This is often excused, by some
modern writers, from the respect they bear to them, who first
practised it; though it can hardly be vindicated from the
charge of will-worship, since no countenance is given to it in
scripture.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which is generally alleged in their behalf, is, that they
supposed the souls of believers did not immediately enter into
heaven, but were sequestered, or disposed of in some place inferior
to it, which they sometimes call <i>paradise</i>, or <i>Abraham’s
bosom</i>, where they are to continue till their souls are re-united
to their bodies. Whether this place be above or below the
earth, all are not agreed; but their mistake arises from their
misunderstanding those scriptures which describe heaven under
these metaphorical characters of <i>paradise</i>, or <i>Abraham’s
bosom</i><a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c012'><sup>[104]</sup></a>. Here they suppose that they are, indeed, delivered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>from the afflictions and miseries of this present life; but yet
not possessed of perfect blessedness in God’s immediate presence.
Therefore they conclude, that there was some room
for prayer, that the degree of happiness which they were possessed
of, might be continued, or rather, that it might in the
end, be perfected, when they are raised from the dead, and admitted
to partake of the heavenly blessedness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Others thought, that at death, the sentence was not peremptorily
past either on the righteous or the wicked, so that
there was room left for them to pray for the increase of the
happiness of the one, or of the mitigation of the torment of the
other; and therefore, in different respects, they prayed for all,
both good and bad, especially for those who were within the
pale or inclosure of the church; and above all, for such as
were useful to, and highly esteemed by it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The principal thing that is said in vindication of this practice
(for what has been but now mentioned, as the ground and
reason thereof, will by no means justify it) is, that though the
souls of believers are in heaven; yet their happiness will not
be, in all respects, complete, till the day of judgment: Therefore,
in their prayers, they chiefly had regard to the consummation
of their blessedness at Christ’s second coming, together
with the continuance thereof, till then; without supposing
that they received any other advantage thereby. And, inasmuch
as this is not a matter of uncertainty, they farther observe,
that many things are to be prayed for, which shall certainly
come to pass, whether we pray for them or no; <i>e. g.</i>
the gathering of the whole number of the elect, and the coming
of Christ’s kingdom of glory: Therefore they suppose, that the
advantage principally redounds to those who put up prayers to
God for them, as hereby they express their faith in the doctrine
of the resurrection, and the future blessedness of the
saints, and the communion that there is between the church
militant and triumphant.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is the fairest colour that can be put upon that ancient
practice of the church, and the many instances that we meet
with, in the writings of the Fathers, concerning their prayers
for the dead<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c012'><sup>[105]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Thus concerning the practice of the church, before we read
of the fictitious place which the Papists call <i>purgatory</i>; where
they fancy, that separate souls endure some degrees of torment,
and are relieved by the prayers of their surviving friends;
which was not known to the church before the seventh century;
and is without any foundation from scripture, as has been
before observed under a foregoing answer<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c012'><sup>[106]</sup></a>. Now since this
was formerly defended, and is now practised by the Papists,
the contrary doctrine is asserted in this answer, <i>viz.</i> that we
are not to pray for the dead; and that this may farther appear,
let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>That the state of every man is unalterably fixed, at death;
so that nothing remains which can be called an addition to the
happiness of the one, or the misery of the other, but what is the
result of the re-union of the soul and body at the resurrection;
and therefore to pray that the saints may have greater degrees
of glory conferred upon them, or sinners a release from that
state of misery in which they are, is altogether ungrounded;
and therefore such prayers must be concluded to be unlawful.</p>

<p class='c006'>That the state of man is fixed at death is sufficiently evident
from scripture: Thus our Saviour, in the parable of the <i>rich
man</i> and <i>Lazarus</i>, speaks of the one as immediately <i>carried
by the angels into Abraham’s bosom</i>, Luke xvi. 22, <i>&amp;c.</i> (by
which, notwithstanding what some ancient writers have asserted
to the contrary, we are to understand heaven;) and the
other as being in a place of <i>torments</i>, without any hope or probability
of the least mitigation thereof; whereby hell, not purgatory
is intended: And the apostle says, <i>It is appointed unto
men once to die, and after this the judgment</i>, Heb. ix. 27, by
which he intends, that all men must leave the world; and when
they are parted from it, their state is determined by Christ;
though this is not done in so public and visible a manner, as
it will be in the general judgment: If therefore the state of
men be unalterably fixed at death; it may be justly inferred
from thence, that there is no room for any one to put up prayers
to God on their behalf: Prayer must have some proof on
which it relies, otherwise it cannot be addressed to God by
faith; or, as the apostle expresses it, <i>nothing wavering</i>, James
i. 6. Now, if we have no ground to conclude that our prayers
shall be heard and answered; or have any doubt in our spirits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>whether the thing prayed for be agreeable to the will of
God; such a prayer cannot be put up in faith, and therefore
is not lawful.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 1. The Papists, in defence of the contrary doctrine,
are very much at a loss for scriptures to support it: However,
there is one, taken from a passage in the apocryphal writings,
in which Judas Maccabeus, and his company, are represented
as praying and offering a sin-offering, and thereby making reconciliation
for the dead, <i>i. e.</i> some that had been slain in battle,
2 Maccab. xii. 43,-45.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> The reply that some make to this, is, that the prayers
for the dead here spoken of, are of a different nature from those
which the Papists make use of in the behalf of those whom
they pretend to be in purgatory, or, that they prayed for
nothing but what some of the Fathers, as before-mentioned
did, <i>viz.</i> that they might be raised from the dead, whereby
they expressed their faith in the doctrine of the resurrection:
But, I think there is a better reply may be given to it, namely,
that the argument is not taken from any inspired writing; and
therefore no more credit is to be given to it than any other human
composure, in which some things are true, and others false:
And as for this book in particular, the author himself plainly intimates
that he did not receive it by divine inspiration; for he
says, <i>If I have done well, and as it is fitting the story, it is that
which I desired; but if slenderly and meanly, it is that which
I could attain unto</i>, chap. xv. 38. which is very honestly said;
but not like an inspired writer, and therefore nothing that is
said therein is a sufficient proof of any important article of
faith or practice, such as that is, which we are now defending.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 2. It is farther objected, that the apostle Paul puts up
a short and affectionate prayer for Onesiphorus, in 2 Tim. i.
18. <i>The Lord grant unto him, that he may find mercy of the
Lord in that day</i>; whereas, it is concluded by some, that, at
the time the apostle wrote this epistle, Onesiphorus was dead,
since there are two petitions put up, one in this verse for him,
and another in ver. 16. for <i>his house</i>; and in chap. iv. 19.
when he salutes some of his friends, according to his custom,
he makes mention of the <i>household of Onesiphorus</i>, not of him.
This turn Grotius himself gives of this scripture<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c012'><sup>[107]</sup></a>. And the
Papists greedily embrace it, as it gives countenance to their
practice of praying for the dead.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> It is but a weak foundation that this argument is
built on; for though Paul salutes his household, and not himself,
in the close of this epistle, it does not follow from hence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>that he was dead; for he might be absent from his family at
this time, as he often was, when engaged in public service, as
being sent by the church, as their messenger, to enquire concerning
the progress and success of the gospel in other parts;
or to carry relief to those who were suffering in Christ’s cause:
It may be, the apostle might be informed that he was then in
his way to Rome, where he was himself a prisoner when he
wrote this epistle; and if so, it would not have been proper to
send salutations to him, whom he expected shortly to see,
while, at the same time, he testified the great love he bore to
him and all his family, as being a man of uncommon zeal for
the interest of Christ and religion.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) They are not to be prayed for who have sinned the
sin unto death. This sin we read of, as what excludes persons
from forgiveness, in scripture, Matt. xii. 32. in which
such things are said concerning it, as should make us fear and
tremble, not only lest we should be left to commit it, but give
way to those sins which border upon it; and there is enough
expressed therein to encourage us to hope that we have not
committed it; which is the principal thing to be insisted on,
when we treat on this subject in our public discourses, or
any are tempted to fear, lest they are guilty of it. Here let it
be observed, that though it be called <i>the sin unto death</i>, we are
not to suppose that it is one particular act of sin, but rather a
course or complication of sins, wherein there are many ingredients
of the most heinous nature. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That it cannot be committed by any but those who
have been favoured with gospel light; for it always contains
in it a rejection of the gospel, which supposes the revelation or
preaching thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] It is not merely a rejecting the gospel, though attended
with sufficient objective evidence, in those who have not had
an inward conviction of the truth thereof, or whose opposition
to it proceeds principally from ignorance, as the apostle says
concerning himself, that <i>though he was a blasphemer, a persecutor,
and injurious; yet he obtained mercy, because he did it ignorantly,
in unbelief</i>, 1 Tim. i. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] It is a rejecting the gospel which we once professed to
embrace, and therefore carries in it the nature of apostacy:
Thus the Scribes and Pharisees, when they attended on John’s
ministry, professed their willingness to adhere to Christ, and
afterwards, when he first appeared publicly in the world, they
were convinced in their consciences, by the miracles which he
wrought, that he was the Messiah; though, after this they were
offended in him, and ashamed to own him, because of the humbled
state and condition in which he appeared in the world;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>for which reason, they, in particular, were charged with this
sin in the scripture before-mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] It also contains in it a rejecting of Christ and the known
truth, out of envy, and this attended with reviling, persecuting,
and using their utmost endeavours to extirpate and
banish it out of the world, and beget in the minds of men the
greatest detestation of it: Thus the Jews are said to <i>deliver
Christ out of envy</i>, Matt. xxvii, 18. and with the same spirit
they persecuted the gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] Such as are guilty of this sin, have no conviction in
their consciences of any crime committed herein; but stop
their ears against all reproof, and set themselves, with the
greatest hatred and malice, against those, who, with faithfulness,
admonish them to the contrary.</p>

<p class='c006'>[6.] They go out of the way of God’s ordinances, and wilfully
exclude themselves from the means of grace, which they
treat with the utmost contempt, and use all those endeavours
that are in their power, that others may be deprived of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>[7.] This condition they not only live but die in; so that
their apostacy is not only total, but final.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, I cannot but observe, that some are of opinion
that this sin cannot be now committed, because we have not
the dispensation of miracles, whereby the Christian religion
was incontestibly proved, in our Saviour’s and the apostles’
time: And the main thing in which it consisted in the scripture
before-mentioned, in Matt. xii. was, in that the Pharisees
were charged with saying, that Christ <i>cast out devils by Beelzebub,
the prince of the devils</i>; whereby they intimate that those
miracles, which they had before been convinced of the truth
of, as being wrought by the finger of God, were wrought by
the devil: which supposes that they were eye-witnesses to
such-like miracles wrought, which we cannot be: Therefore it
is concluded by some, that this sin cannot now be committed;
inasmuch as the dispensation of miracles is ceased. But this
method of reasoning will not appear so strong and conclusive,
if we consider, that though, it is true, the gospel is not now
confirmed to us by miracles; yet we have no less ground to
believe that the christian religion was confirmed by this means,
than if we had been present at the working of these miracles.
Nevertheless, though it should be alleged, that this ingredient
cannot, in every circumstance, be contained in the sin against
the Holy Ghost, in our day; yet there are other things included
in the description of it, before-mentioned, in which it
principally consists, that bear a very great resemblance to that
sin which we have been considering: As for instance, if persons
have formerly believed Christ to be the Messiah, and
been persuaded that this was incontestibly proved by the miracles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>which he wrought, and accordingly, were inclined to
adhere to him, and embrace the gospel, wherein his person and
glory are set forth; and yet have afterwards apostatized from
this profession; and if this had been attended with envy and
malice against Christ; and if they have treated the evidence
which they once acknowledged, the Christian religion, to have
been undeniably supported by, with contempt and blasphemy;
and have totally rejected that faith which they once professed,
arising from carnal policy, and the love of this world; and
when this is attended with judicial hardness of heart, blindness
of mind, and strong delusions, together with a rooted hatred of
all religion, and a malicious persecution of those that embrace
it; This is what we cannot but conclude to bear a very great
resemblance to that which, in scripture, is called the unpardonable
sin; and it is a most deplorable case, which should be so
far improved by us, as that we should use the utmost caution,
that we may not give way to those sins which bear the least resemblance
to it: Nevertheless, doubting christians are to take
heed that they do not apply this account that has been given
of it to themselves, so as to lead them to despair; which is
not the design of any description thereof, which we have in
scripture. Now that these may be fortified against such-like
objections, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That it is one thing peremptorily to determine that it is
impossible for any one to commit this sin in our day, since the
dispensation of miracles is ceased, (which is, in effect, to suppose
that we can have no evidence for the truth of the Christian
religion, but what is founded on occular demonstration;
such as they who saw Christ’s miracles;) and another thing to
determine concerning particular persons, that they are guilty of
this sin. It is certain that this matter might be determined
with special application to particular persons in our Saviour’s
and the apostles’ time, when there was among other extraordinary
gifts, that of discerning of spirits; and consequently it
might be known, whether they who apostatized from the faith
of the gospel, had before this, received a full conviction of the
truth thereof; and it might then be known, by extraordinary
revelation, that God would never give them repentance, and
therefore their apostacy would be final; and, it is more than
probable, that this was supposed by the apostle, when he
speaks of some that had committed this sin, who are not to be
prayed for: But these things cannot be known by us; therefore
I would not advise any one to forbear to pray for the worst
of sinners, who seem most to resemble those that are charged
with this sin, this matter not being certainly known by us.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, That which is principally to be considered for the encouragement
of those who are afraid that they have committed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>this sin, is, that persons certainly know that they have not
committed it, though they are in an unregenerate state; as,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, When <i>they have not had opportunity</i>, or those means that
are necessary to attain the knowledge of the truth, and so remain
ignorant thereof; or if they have had sufficient means to
know it, they have not committed this sin, <i>if they desire and
resolve to wait on God in his ordinances</i>, in order to their receiving
good thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, They <i>who are under conviction of sin</i>, disapprove of,
and <i>have some degree of sorrow and shame for it</i>, may certainly
conclude that they have not committed the sin against the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, If persons have reason to think that their hearts are
hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, and that they are
greatly backslidden from God; yet they ought not to conclude
that they have committed this sin, <i>if they are afraid lest
they should be given up to a perpetual backsliding</i>, or dread
nothing more than a total and a final apostacy; upon which
account they are induced to pray against it, and to <i>desire a
broken heart, and that faith, which, at present, they do not experience</i>.
In this case, though their state be dangerous, yet
they ought not to determine against themselves, that they have
committed the sin unto death.</p>

<p class='c006'>The use which we ought to make of this awful doctrine,
and the hope that there is that we have not committed this sin
is,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That we should <i>take heed that we do not give way to wilful
impenitency, and a contempt of the means of grace</i>, lest we
should provoke God to give us up to judicial hardness of
heart, so as to make sad advances towards the commission
thereof: Let us take heed that we do not sin against the light
and conviction of our own consciences, <i>and wilfully neglect
and oppose the means of grace</i>, which, whether it be the sin
unto death or no, is certainly a crime of the most heinous and
dangerous tendency.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Let doubting christians <i>take heed that they do not give
way to Satan’s suggestions</i>, tempting them to conclude that
they have committed this sin; which they are sometimes afraid
that they have, though they might determine that they have
not, did they duly weigh what has been but now observed concerning
this matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. <i>Let us bless God, that yet there is a door of hope, and resolve
by his grace</i>, that we will always wait on him in the ordinances
which he has appointed, till he shall be pleased to give
us ground to conclude better things concerning ourselves, even
things that accompany salvation. This leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. What we are to pray for; particularly,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>1. For those things which concern the glory of God. And
that we may know what they are, we are to enquire; whether,
if God should give us what we ask for, it would have a tendency
to set forth any of his divine perfections, and thereby
render him amiable and adorable in the eyes of his creatures,
so that in answering our prayers, he would act becoming himself?
We are also to take an estimate of this matter, from the
intimation he has given us hereof in his word, in which we may
observe, not only whether he has given us leave, but commands
and encourages us to ask for it; more especially, whether he
has promised to give it to us; and, whether our receiving the
blessing we ask for, has a tendency to fit us for his service,
that hereby praise that waits for him, may be ascribed to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are to pray for those things which concern our own
good, or the good of others. These are particularly insisted on
in the Lord’s prayer, which is explained in the following answers;
therefore it is sufficient for us, at present, to consider
the good we are to pray for in general, namely, temporal blessings,
which are the effects of divine bounty, concerning which,
our Saviour says, <i>Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have
need of these things</i>, Mat. vi. 32. We are also to pray for
spiritual blessings, such as forgiveness of sin, strength against
it, and the sanctifying influences of the Spirit, to produce in
us holiness of heart and life; as also, for deliverance from, and
victory over our spiritual enemies. We are also to pray for
the consolations of the holy Ghost, arising from assurance of
the love of God, whereby we may have peace and joy in believing;
and for all those blessings which may make us happy
in a better world.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We are to pray for those things which are lawful to be
asked of God; and accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) The things we pray for, must be such as it is possible
for us to receive, and particularly such as God has determined
to bestow, or given us ground to expect, in this present world:
Therefore we are not to pray for those blessings to be applied
here, which he has reserved for the heavenly state; such as a
perfect freedom from sin, tribulation or temptation, or our enjoying
the immediate views of the glory of God: These things
are to be desired in that time and order, in which God has determined
to bestow them; therefore we are to wait for them
till we come to heaven, and, at present, we are to desire only
to be made partakers of those privileges which he gives to his
children in their way thither.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We are not to pray that God would inflict evils on
others, to satisfy our private revenge for injuries done us;
since this is, in itself, unlawful, and unbecoming a Christian
frame of spirit, and contrary to that duty which was before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>considered, of our praying for our very enemies, and seeking
their good.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) We are not to ask for outward blessings without setting
bounds to our desires thereof; nor are we to ask for them unseasonably,
or for wrong ends. We are not to pray for them
as though they were our chief good and happiness, or of equal
importance with things that are more immediately conducive
to our spiritual advantage; and therefore, whatever measure
of importunity we express in praying for them, it is not to be
inconsistent with an entire submission to the divine will, as
being satisfied that God knows what is best for us; or, whether
that which we desire, will, in the end, prove good or hurtful
to us; much less ought we to ask for outward blessings, that
we may abuse, and, as the apostle James speaks, <i>Consume them
upon our lusts</i>, James iv. 3.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXXXV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXXV.</span> <i>How are we to pray?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> We are to pray with an awful apprehension of the
Majesty of God, and deep sense of our own unworthiness,
necessities, and sins, with penitent, thankful, and enlarged
hearts, with understanding, faith, sincerity, fervency, love,
and perseverance, waiting upon him, with humble submission
to his will.</p>

<p class='c011'>This answer respects the manner of performing this duty,
and the frame of spirit with which we are to draw nigh
to God. Accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. We are to pray with an awful apprehension of the Majesty
of God; otherwise our behaviour would be highly resented
by him, and reckoned no other than a thinking him
altogether such an one as ourselves. Some of the divine perfections
have a more immediate tendency to excite an holy
reverence; accordingly we are to consider him as omnipresent,
and omniscient, to whom our secret thoughts, and the principle
from whence our actions proceed, are better known than
they can be to themselves. We are to conceive of him as a God
of infinite holiness; and therefore he cannot but be highly
displeased with that worship that is opposite thereunto, as proceeding
from a conscience defiled with sin, or performed in an
unholy manner. Thus the prophet says, <i>Thou art of purer
eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity</i>, Hab. i.
13. that is, thou canst not behold it without the utmost detestation;
and therefore, <i>if we regard it in our heart, he will not
hear</i> our prayers, Psal. lxvi. 18. We are also to have a due
sense of the spirituality of his nature, that we may worship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>him in a spiritual manner; therefore we are not to entertain
any carnal conceptions, or frame any ideas of him, like those
we have of finite or corporeal beings; nor are we to think it
sufficient, that our external mien and deportment have been
grave, and carried in it a shew of reverence, when our hearts
have not, at the same time, been engaged in this duty, or disposed
to give him the glory that is due to his name. We are
also to draw nigh to him with a due sense of those perfections
that tend to encourage us to perform this duty, with hope of
finding acceptance in his sight. Therefore we are to conceive
of him, as a God of infinite goodness, mercy, and faithfulness,
with whom is plenteous redemption, in and through a Mediator,
which is suitable to our condition, as indigent, miserable,
and guilty sinners; and a God of infinite power, who is <i>able
to do exceeding abundantly above all we are able to ask or think</i>,
Eph. iii. 20.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are to pray to God with an humble sense of our own
unworthiness. This is the necessary result of those high conceptions
we have of his divine excellency and greatness;
whereby we are led to consider ourselves as infinitely below
him; and, indeed, the best of creatures are induced hereby to
worship him with the greatest humility: Thus the Seraphim
are represented in that vision, which the prophet Isaiah had of
them, as ministering to, and attending upon our Lord Jesus,
when sitting on a throne on his temple; as <i>covering their faces
and their feet with their wings</i>, denoting their unworthiness
to behold his glory, or to be employed by him in his service,
Isa. vi. 1-4. But when we take a view of his infinite holiness,
and our own impurity, this should be an inducement to
us to draw nigh to him, with the greatest humility: As dependent
creatures, we have nothing but what we derive from
him; as frail dying creatures, we wither away, and are brought
to nothing, Job xiii. 25. Job compares this to a leaf that is
easily broken, and driven to and fro, or to the dry stubble,
that can make no resistance against the wind that pursues it;
and the Psalmist, speaking of man in general, says, <i>Lord, what
is man, that thou takest knowledge of him; or the son of man,
that thou makest account of him?</i> Psal. civ. 3. And elsewhere
it is said, <i>What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him, and
that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</i> Job vii. 17. These
are humbling considerations; but we shall be led into a farther
sense of our own unworthiness, when we consider ourselves as
sinful creatures, worthy to be abhorred by God; therefore he
might justly reject us, and refuse to answer our prayers. But
since this humble frame of spirit is so necessary for the right
performance of this duty, let us farther observe, as an inducement
hereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>(1.) That the greatest glory we can bring to God can make
no addition to his infinite perfections: Thus it is said, <i>Can a
man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable
unto himself? Is it any pleasure, that is, any advantage, to the
Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou
makest thy ways perfect?</i> Job xxiii. 2, 3. And elsewhere, <i>If
thou be righteous, what givest thou him, or what receiveth he of
thy hand?</i> ch. xxxv. 7. denoting that it is impossible for us,
by any thing we can do or suffer for his sake, to make him
more glorious than he would have been in himself, had we
never had a being: Therefore, if there is nothing by which we
can lay any obligations on God, we have reason to address ourselves
to him with a sense of our own unworthiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We are so far from meriting any good thing from the
hand of God, that by our repeated transgressions, notwithstanding
the daily mercies we receive from him, we give farther
proofs of our great unworthiness; and, indeed, if we are
enabled to do any thing in obedience to his will, this is not
from ourselves; yea, it is contrary to the dictates of corrupt
nature, and must be ascribed to him as the author of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) If we could do the greatest service to God by espousing
his cause, and promoting his interest in the world; it is
no more than what we are bound to do; and, at the same time
we must consider, that <i>it is God that worketh in</i> us, <i>both to
will and to do of his good pleasure</i>, Phil. ii. 13.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) The best believers recorded in scripture, have entertained
a constant, humble sense of their own unworthiness:
Thus Abraham, when he stood before the Lord, making supplications
in the behalf of Sodom, expresses himself thus, <i>Behold,
now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am
but dust and ashes</i>. And Jacob says, <i>I am not worthy of the
least of all thy mercies, and of all the truth which thou hast shewed
unto thy servant</i>, Gen. xxxii. 10. And they who have been
most zealous for, and made eminently useful in promoting
Christ’s interest in the world, have had an humble sense of
their own unworthiness; as the apostle says concerning himself,
<i>I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called
an apostle</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 9. And he immediately adds, <i>By the
grace of God I am what I am</i>, ver. 10. And elsewhere he
styles himself, <i>less than the least of all saints</i>, Eph. iii. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have another instance of humility in prayer, in the
Psalmist’s words, <i>I am a worm, and no man</i>, Psal. xxii. 6.
which, so far as they have any reference to his own case, may
give us occasion to infer, that the most advanced circumstances,
in which any are in the world, are not inconsistent with humility,
when drawing nigh to God in prayer; but if we consider
him speaking in the person of Christ, as several expressions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>of this Psalm argue him to do, and cannot well be taken
in any other sense<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c012'><sup>[108]</sup></a>; then we have herein the most remarkable
instance of the humble address that was used by Christ
in his human nature, when drawing nigh to God in prayer;
which is certainly a great motive to induce us to engage in this
duty with the utmost humility.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We are to draw nigh to God in prayer, with a sense of
our necessities, and the sins that we have committed against
him. Accordingly, we are to consider ourselves as indigent
creatures, who are stripped and deprived of that glory, and
those bright ornaments which were put on man at first in his
state of innocency; destitute of the divine image, and all those
things that are necessary to our happiness, unless he is pleased
to supply these wants, forgive our iniquities, and grant us
communion with himself; which things we are to draw nigh
to him in prayer for. We are also, in this duty, to have a
sense of sin, <i>viz.</i> the guilt that we contract thereby, and the
punishment we have exposed ourselves to, that we may see
our need of drawing nigh to God in Christ’s righteousness;
and also of the stain and pollution thereof, which may induce
us to fall down before the footstool of the throne of grace, with
the greatest degree of self-abhorrence. We are also to consider
how we are enslaved to sin, how much we have been,
and how prone we are at all times, to <i>serve divers lusts and
pleasures</i>, Tit. iii. 3. and to <i>walk according to the course of this
world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
that now worketh in the children of disobedience</i>, Eph. ii. 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we are to consider sin as deeply rooted in our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>hearts, debasing our affections, and captivating our wills. If
we are in an unconverted state, we are to look upon it as
growing and encreasing in us, rendering us more and more
indisposed for what is good, by which means we are set at a
farther distance from God and holiness: On the other hand,
if we have ground to hope we are made partakers of converting
grace, then we have acted contrary to the highest obligations,
and been guilty of the greatest ingratitude. These
things we are to endeavour to be affected with, when drawing
nigh to God in prayer, in order to our performing this duty
aright.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. There are several graces that are to be exercised in
prayer;</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Repentance: This is necessary, because we are sinners;
and as such, are to come into the presence of God with confession,
joined with supplication which must be made with a
penitent frame of spirit; the contrary to which, is a tacit approbation
of sin, and a kind of resolution to adhere to it, which
is very unbecoming those who are pleading for forgiveness:
Accordingly, when God promised that he would <i>pour out upon
the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the
spirit of grace and of supplications</i>, he adds, that <i>they shall
look upon him, whom they have pierced, and mourn for him</i>, or
for it, <i>as one mourneth for his only son; and shall be in bitterness,
as one that is in bitterness for his first-born</i>: And that
this shall be done by <i>every family apart, and their wives apart</i>,
Zech. xii. 10. <i>&amp; seq.</i> So when <i>the priests, the ministers of
the Lord</i>, are commanded to <i>pray</i>, that <i>he</i> would <i>spare his
people</i>; they, are, at the same time, to <i>weep between the porch
and the altar, to rent their hearts, and turn unto the Lord their
God</i>, Joel ii. 13. 17. And when Israel is advised to <i>take with
them words</i>, and instructed how they should pray, they are
exhorted to <i>turn unto the Lord</i>; to repent of their seeking help
from Assyria and Egypt, and of that abominable idolatry
which they had been guilty of, Hos. xiv. 1, 2, 3, 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now there are several subjects very proper for our meditation;
which may, through the divine blessing accompanying
it, excite this grace, when we are engaged in the duty of
prayer; particularly the multitude of transgressions which are
charged on the consciences of men by the law, that <i>every mouth
may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God</i>,
Rom. iii. 19. and especially the ingratitude which we have
reason to accuse ourselves of, and our contempt of Christ, and
the way of salvation by him, which is discovered in the gospel;
and our having done many things in the course of our
lives, which fill us with shame and sorrow, whenever we come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>into the presence of God, to pour out our hearts before him
in this duty.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The next grace to be exercised in prayer is, thankfulness,
in which respect prayer and praise ought to be joined
together: Thus the Psalmist says, <i>Praise waiteth for thee O
God, in Zion, and unto thee shall the vow be performed, O thou
that hearest prayer</i>, Psal. lxv. 1, 2. That this is a part of
prayer has been observed under a foregoing answer; in which
we considered the many blessings that we have reason to be
thankful for. I shall only add, at present, that it is matter of
thankfulness, that we have liberty of access to God, in hope of
obtaining mercy from him, as sitting on a throne of grace, who
might have been forever banished from his presence, or have
been brought before his judgment-seat as criminals, doomed to
everlasting destruction.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we are to bless him, not only that we have leave
to come before him, but have often experienced that he has
heard, and answered our prayers, and therein has fulfilled that
promise, <i>I said not to the seed of Jacob, seek ye me in vain</i>,
Isa. xlv. 19. And that we may be brought into a thankful
frame, we ought to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] The worth of every mercy; especially those that are
spiritual, or accompany salvation; and this we may judge of
by the price that was paid for it, which is no less than the
blood of Jesus; which the apostle not only styles <i>precious</i>, but
speaks of it as infinitely preferable to every thing that is <i>corruptible</i>,
1 Pet. i. 18, 19. And we may, in some measure,
take an estimate thereof by the worth and excellency of the
soul, and as it is conducive to promote its eternal welfare.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] We are also to consider every saving blessing, as the
fruit and result of everlasting love, and as the consequence of
God’s eternal design, in having chosen those, who are the objects
thereof, to salvation in Christ, Jer. xxxi. 3. Eph. i. 3, 4.
We must also consider these mercies as discriminating, whereby
God distinguishes his people from the world, and herein
glorifies the riches of his grace, in those who deserve to have
been, for ever, the monuments of his wrath: We might here
consider, as an inducement to this grace of thankfulness, the
aggravations of the sin of ingratitude.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, It is a virtual disowning our obligation to, or dependence
on God, from whom we receive all mercies, and a behaving
ourselves in such a manner as though we were not
beholden to him for them, or could be happy without him; as
though we were self-sufficient, and did not look upon him as
the fountain of blessedness.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, It is a refusing to give him the glory of his wisdom,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>power, goodness, and faithfulness, which are eminently displayed
in the blessings that he bestows.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, It is disagreeable to the large expectations we have of
those blessings he has reserved for his people, or promised to
them, or that hope which he has laid up for them in heaven.
Therefore we cannot but conclude that ingratitude argues a
person destitute of that holiness which eminently discovers itself
in the exercise of the contrary grace: Accordingly the
apostle joins these two characters together, when speaking
of the vilest of men, whom he styles, <i>unthankful, unholy</i>, 2
Tim. iii. 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Another grace, to be exercised in prayer, is faith.
This implies an habitual disposition of soul, proceeding from
a principle of regenerating grace, whereby we are led to commit
ourselves, and all our concerns, into Christ’s hand, depending
on his merits and mediation for the supply of all our
wants, considering him as having purchased, and as being
authorized to apply, all the benefits of the covenant of
grace, which are the subject-matter of our supplications to
him. More particularly, faith exerts and discovers itself in
prayer,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] By encouraging the soul, and giving it an holy boldness
to draw nigh to God, notwithstanding our great unworthiness.
If we are afraid to come into the presence of an holy
God, and, destruction from him is a terror to us, if the threatnings
he has denounced against sinners, such as we know
ourselves to be, discourage us from drawing nigh to him, so
that we are ready to say with Job, ‘Therefore am I troubled
at his presence; when I consider, I am afraid of him,’
Job xxiii. 15. If his almighty power, that can easily sink us
into perdition, overwhelms our spirits, and fills us with the
utmost distress and confusion, so that we cannot draw nigh
to him in prayer, considering him as an absolute God; we
are encouraged by faith, to look upon him as our covenant
God, and Father in Christ; and then all his divine perfections
will afford relief to us. His sin-revenging justice is regarded
by faith, as that which is fully satisfied by Christ’s obedience
and sufferings; and therefore will not demand that satisfaction
at our hands, which it has already received from our
surety, who was ‘made sin for us’ though he ‘knew no sin,
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him,’ 2
Cor. v. 21. His infinite power is no longer looked upon, as
engaged to destroy us, but rather to succour us under all our
weakness; and therefore, as Job says, ‘He will not plead
against us with his great power; no, but he will put strength
in us,’ Job xxiii. 6. We consider it as ready to support us
under the heaviest pressures, and so enable us to perform the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>most difficult duties, and to overcome all our spiritual enemies,
who would be otherwise too strong for us: So that this
attribute is so far from discouraging us from drawing nigh
to God in prayer, that, by faith, we behold it as delighting
to exert and glorify itself, in doing those great things for
us which we have in view, when we engage in this duty.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Faith discovers itself in prayer, by enabling us to plead,
and apply to ourselves, the great and precious promises which
God has given to his people in the gospel. As prayer cannot
subsist without a promise, so we are enabled, by faith, to apprehend
and plead the promises, and to say, ‘Remember the
word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me
to hope,’ Psal. cxix. 49. And hereby we look upon God as
ready to bestow the blessings which he has promised, and
his faithfulness as engaged to make them good. Accordingly
the Psalmist says, ‘Hear my prayer, O Lord, give ear
to my supplications; in thy faithfulness answer me, and in
thy righteousness,’ Psal. cxliii. 1. There is nothing that we
want, or ought to pray for, but there are some promises, contained
in the word of God, which faith improves and takes
encouragement from in this duty: And since what we pray
for, respects either temporal, or spiritual, and eternal blessings,
these are looked upon by faith as promised; as the apostle
says, <i>godliness has the promise of the life that now is, and of
that which is to come</i>, 1 Tim. iv. 18. This might be very largely
insisted on, and many instances given hereof, which are
contained in scripture; but I shall more especially consider
those promises which respect God’s enabling us to pray, and
his hearing and answering our prayers, which faith lays hold
on, and improves, in order to our performing this duty in a
right manner.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, There are promises of the Spirit’s assistance to enable
us to pray. This the apostle calls his <i>making intercession for
us, according to the will of God</i>, in Rom. viii. 27. And our
Saviour says, in Luke xii. 13. <i>If ye then, being evil, know
how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall
your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, There are other promises that respect God’s hearing
and answering prayer. Thus it is said, in Psal. lxxxvi. 7. <i>In
the day of my trouble I will call upon thee for thou wilt answer
me</i>: And elsewhere in Psal. cii. 17. <i>God will regard the
prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer.</i> This is
considered as being of a very large extent: Thus our Saviour
says, in John xvi. 23. <i>Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my
name, he will give it you</i>: And in chap. xv. 7. <i>If ye abide in
me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and
it shall be done unto you</i>: Which universal expressions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>God’s giving believers <i>what they will</i>, are to be understood of
his granting their lawful and regular desires; and, indeed,
faith will never ask any thing but what tends to the glory of
God, and that with an entire submission to his will; though
it is far otherwise with respect to those prayers that are not
put up in faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover God has promised to hear and answer all kinds
of prayer, provided they proceed from this grace; particularly,
united prayers in the assemblies of his saints, as he says
to Solomon, after the dedication of the temple, in 2 Chron.
vii. 15. <i>Mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the
prayer that is made in this place</i>; and those prayers that are
put up to God in families, where a small number are joined
together; though it be but <i>two or three</i>, Christ has promised
to be <i>in the midst of them</i>, xviii. 20. not only to assist them in
this duty, but to give them what they ask for. There are
also promises made to secret prayer: Thus when our Saviour
encourages his people to <i>pray to their Father, which is in secret</i>,
he tells them, <i>My Father which seeth in secret, shall reward
thee openly</i>, chap. vi. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it will be enquired, whether it be necessary in order
to our praying by faith, that we be assured, at all times, that
our prayer shall be heard.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this it may be answered,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That it is not our duty to believe that every prayer
shall be heard; for God heareth not sinners, that is, those who
are under the reigning power of sin, and consequently are destitute
of the grace of faith; nor will he hear those <i>prayers</i>
that <i>proceed from feigned lips</i>: Thus it is said, <i>If I regard
iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me</i>, Psal. lxvi. 18.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, It is not the duty of those who have the truth of
grace, to believe that their prayer shall be heard, when, by
reason of their infirmity, or the weakness of their faith, they
ask for that which is unlawful, and not redounding to the glory
of God and their real good.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, If what we pray for may be for the glory of God, and
redound to our advantage; yet it is not our duty to determine,
with too great peremptoriness, that he will certainly grant
what we ask for, immediately, or in that particular way which
we desire; since he may answer prayer, and yet do it in his
own time and way.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, It is not our duty to believe assuredly, that God
will give us all those temporal blessings that we ask for;
especially if they be not absolutely necessary for us, since he
may answer such-like prayers in value, though not in kind, and
so give spiritual blessings, instead of those temporal ones,
which we pray for; in which case none will say, that he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>unfaithful to his promise, though we have not those blessings
in kind that we desire: Therefore it is our duty, and the great
concern of faith in prayer, to be assured, that as God knows
what is best for us, so he will make good his promises, in such
a way, that we shall have no reason to conclude ourselves to
have been disappointed, or that we have asked in faith, but
have not obtained.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am sensible that there is a difficulty in the mode of expression
used by the apostle James, in chap. i. 6, 7. <i>But let
him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for let not that man think
that he shall receive any thing of the Lord</i>: By which, the apostle
does not intend, that he who doubts whether his prayer
shall be answered, cannot be said, in any sense, to pray in
faith; for, as assurance of our salvation is not of the essence
of faith, so that faith cannot subsist without it; in like manner
assurance, or a firm persuasion that the very thing we ask
shall be given, is not such an essential ingredient in prayer, as
that we should determine, that for want of it, we shall receive
nothing that is good from the Lord. Therefore, I conceive,
that the apostle, by <i>wavering</i> in this text, rather respects
our being in doubt about the object of faith; or else
our not being stedfast in the grace of faith, but praying with
hypocrisy, as he illustrates it by the similitude taken from a
<i>wave driven with the wind</i>; which sometimes moves one way,
at other times the contrary; and he farther explains it, when
he says, in ver. 8. <i>a double-minded man, is unstable in all his
ways</i>; so that the person, whom he describes as wavering is
the same with a <i>double-minded man</i>, or an hypocrite: Such
an one cannot ask in faith; therefore the apostle does not
hereby intend that no one can exercise this grace in prayer,
but he that has a full assurance that his prayer shall be answered,
in that particular way and manner as he expects.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 1. It is objected by some, that they have no faith;
therefore since this grace must be exercised in prayer, they
are very often discouraged from performing the duty of
prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> That though the want of a prepared frame of spirit,
for any duty affords matter of humiliation, yet it is no
excuse for the neglect thereof; and as for prayer in particular,
we are to wait on God therein, for a prepared frame of spirit,
that by this means, we may draw nigh to him in a right manner,
as well as for a gracious answer from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] If we cannot bring glory to God by a fiducial pleading
of the promises, or applying them to ourselves; we
must endeavour to glorify him by confessing our guilt and
unworthiness, and acknowledging that all our help is in him.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] It is possible for us to have some acts of faith in prayer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>when we are not sensible thereof, and at the same time, bewail
our want of this grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] If none were to pray but those who have faith, then it
would follow that none must pray for the first grace, which
supposes a person to be in an unregenerate state; nevertheless,
such are obliged to perform this duty, as well as they can,
and therein to hope for that grace which may enable them to
do it as they ought.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c012'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Obj.</i> 2. It is objected by others, that though they dare not
lay aside the duty of prayer, yet, inasmuch as they do not
experience those graces, which are necessary for the right performance
thereof, nor any returns of prayer, they have no
satisfaction in their own spirits.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied;</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That there may be faith in prayer, and yet no immediate
answer thereof. God herein acts in a way of sovereignty,
whereby he will have his people know that if he grants
their requests, it shall be in his own time and way. Therefore
it is their duty to wait for him till he is pleased to
manifest himself as a God hearing prayer, and thereby removing
the discouragements that, at present, they labour under.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, There are other ways by which the truth of grace is
to be judged of, besides our having sensible answers of
prayer. Sometimes, indeed, God may give many intimations
of his acceptance of us, though, at present we know
it not.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) The next grace to be exercised in prayer, is, love to
God: This implies in it an earnest desire of his presence, delight
in him, or taking pleasure in contemplating his perfections
as the most glorious and amiable object. Desire supposes
him, in some measure, withdrawn from us; or that we
are not possessed of that complete blessedness, which is to
be enjoyed in him; and delight supposes him present, and, in
some degree, manifesting himself unto us. Now love to God,
in both these respects, is to be exercised in prayer. Is he in
any measure withdrawn from us? we are, with the greatest
earnestness to long for his return to us, whose loving-kindness
is better than life. Is he graciously pleased, in any degree,
to manifest himself to us as the fountain of all we enjoy
or hope for? this will have a tendency to excite our delight
in him, and induce us to conclude that our happiness consists
in the enjoyment of him. These graces are to be exercised
at all times, but more especially in prayer, which is an offering
up of our desires to God; in which we first press after
the enjoyment of himself, and then of his benefits. And, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>we are to bless and praise him for the discoveries we have
of his glory, in and through our Lord Jesus Christ, in order
to the securing our spiritual good and advantage; this is to
express that delight in him, which is the highest instance of
love.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) Another grace to be exercised in prayer, is submission
to the will of God; whereby we leave ourselves and our petitions
in his hand, as being sensible that he knows what is best
for us. This does not include in it a being indifferent whether
our prayers are heard or no; for that is to contradict
what we express with our lips, by the frame of our spirits.
Whatever may be concluded to be lawful for us to ask, as redounding
to our advantage, and is expressly promised by God,
that we ought to request at his hand, in prayer; and if we
pray for it, we cannot but desire that our prayer may be heard
and answered; and this is not opposed to that submission to
the divine will, which we are speaking of, provided we leave
it to God to do what he thinks best for us, being content that
the way and manner of his answering us, as well as the time
of his bestowing those blessings which we want, together with
the degree thereof; especially if they are such as are of a temporal
nature, ought to be resolved into his sovereign will.
Thus concerning the graces that we are to exercise in prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are other things mentioned in this answer, which are
necessary to our exercising those graces, <i>viz.</i> our minds being
enlightened, our hearts enlarged, and our having sincerity in
the inward part.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] There must be some degree of understanding, since ignorance
is so far from being, as the Papists pretend, the mother
of devotion, that it is inconsistent with the exercise of
those graces, with which we ought to draw nigh to God in
prayer. The affections, indeed, may be moved, where there
is but a very little knowledge of the doctrines of the gospel;
but they will, at the same time, be misled; and this can no
more be called religious devotion than the words or actions of
one that is in a phrenzy, can be called rational; therefore, as
prayer is unacceptable without the exercise of grace, so grace
cannot be exercised without the knowledge of the truth, as derived
from the sacred treasury of scripture.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we might consider, that we must know something
of God who is the object of prayer, as well as of all other
acts of religious worship. We must also know something of
Christ the Mediator, through whom we have access to, as well
as acceptance with him; and something of the work and glory
of the Holy Ghost, on whom we are to depend for his assistance
in presenting our supplications to God. We must know
our necessities, otherwise we cannot tell what to ask for; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>also the promises of the gospel, otherwise we cannot be encouraged
to hope for an answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] In order to our exercising grace in prayer, we must
have some degree of enlargedness of heart; that is, when
every thing that tends to contract our affections, abate the ferfency
of our spirits, or hinder that importunity which we
ought to express for the best of blessings, is removed. Now
our hearts may be said to be enlarged in prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, When we draw nigh to God in this duty with delight
and earnest longing after his presence, and an interest in his
love, which we reckon preferable to all other blessings.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, When we are affected with a becoming sense of his
glorious perfections, and our own nothingness, in order to our
adoring him, and coming before him with the greatest humility.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, When we have suitable promises given in, and are
enabled to plead them with a degree of hope, arising from the
goodness and faithfulness of God, that he will fulfil them; and
that more especially as we draw nigh to him as to a covenant-God.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, When our thoughts and affections are engaged without
wandering, weariness, or lukewarmness, and filled with
importunity, agreeable to the importance of the duty, and our
absolute need of the blessings we pray for.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] In order to our exercising those graces, which are necessary
for our drawing nigh to God aright in prayer, we must
have sincerity of heart: This includes in it much more than
what is generally so called, as opposed to dissimulation, in
those who perform some good actions merely to be seen of
men, or who take up religion to answer some base and vile
end, which they have in view; in which respect a sincere person
is one that is no dissembler: But that sincerity, which we
are speaking of, consists in a person’s acting from a principle
of grace implanted in regeneration; or when a person can appeal
to God, as Job does, <i>Thou knowest that I am not wicked</i>,
Job x. 7. that is, that there is no reigning sin, whereby my
heart is alienated from, or set against thee. A sincere person
is such an one as our Saviour describes, when he speaks of
Nathaniel, and gives him this character, <i>Behold an Israelite
indeed, in whom is no guile</i>, John i. 48. In this case a person’s
heart and actions go together; and he may truly say, as
David does, <i>attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that
goeth not out of feigned lips</i>, Psal. xvii. 1. Thus concerning
the graces that are to be exercised in prayer, and what is necessary
in order thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>What is farther observed concerning this duty, is, that we
are to persevere in prayer; resolving not to desist from waiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>on God therein, whatever seeming discouragements may,
at present, lie in our way. Prayer is not a duty to be performed
only at some certain times, as the prophet speaks of
those who, <i>in their affliction will seek God early</i>, Hos. v. 15. or,
as the mariners in Jonah, who <i>cried, every man unto his god</i>,
in a storm; though it is probable, they seldom prayed at other
times, Jon. i. 5. But we are to <i>pray always with all prayer
and supplication, and</i> to <i>watch thereunto with all perseverance</i>,
Eph. vi. 18. that is, we ought always to endeavour to be in a
praying frame, and, on all occasions, to lift up our hearts to
God for direction, assistance, and success in every thing we
do, agreeable to his will, and for a supply of those wants which
daily recur upon us.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, By reason of the deadness and stupidity of our spirits,
which we cannot bring into a suitable frame for the discharge
of this duty; and therefore we are ready to conclude, that
while we draw nigh to God with our lips, our hearts are far
from him. This is, indeed, a very afflictive case; but we
ought not from hence, to take occasion to lay aside the duty
but rather depend on the assistance of the Spirit, to enable us
to perform it in a right manner.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, Another discouraging circumstance is, God’s denying
us sensible returns of prayer, which he may do for various reasons.
Sometimes he sees those defects that we are guilty of
in prayer, which he is obliged to testify his displeasure against;
and this he sometimes does by hiding himself, or, as it were,
withdrawing from us, and, in all appearance, shutting out our
prayers, that we may take occasion to search out the secret sin
that lies at the root thereof; which we must confess and be
humbled for. Thus when Joshua, after a small defeat, which
Israel had received by the men of Ai, fell upon his face, and
spread the matter before the Lord in prayer, God condescends
to tell him the reason of it; ‘Get thee up, wherefore liest
thou thus upon thy face? Israel hath sinned, and they have
also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them; for
they have even taken of the accursed thing; therefore could
they not stand before their enemies,’ Josh. vii. 10-12. And
when the sin was discovered, and Achan, who troubled them
punished, what he asked for was granted. Again, God may
deny an immediate answer to prayer, out of his mere sovereignty,
that hereby we may know, that it is not for us to prescribe
to him the time or way in which he shall dispense those benefits,
which are not owing to our merit, but his free grace.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Sometimes we pray, but do not use other means, which
God has appointed for the obtaining the blessing! Thus, when
Israel was disheartened, being pursued by Pharaoh and his
host, and did not care to move out of their places, Moses addresses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>himself to God in prayer, and <i>the Lord said unto him,
Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel,
that they go forward</i>; and then he ordered him to <i>lift up his
rod, and stretch it over the sea, and divide it, that they might
go through the midst thereof on dry ground</i>, Exod. xiv. 15, 16.
We are not only to pray, but to use other means that God has
appointed; without which, we cannot expect that prayer should
be answered. Thus Hezekiah, when sick, prayed to God,
who assured him, that he had heard his prayers, and would
heal him; nevertheless, he was to use the means which God
had ordered, by <i>taking a lump of figs and laying it on the boil</i>;
which he did accordingly, and was restored to health, Isa.
xxxviii. 21. Do we pray for a comfortable subsistence in the
world? we must, if we expect that God should answer us, use
industry in our callings, as well as own him by prayer and
supplications. Do we pray for any of the graces of the Spirit
in order to the beginning or carrying on the work of sanctification?
we must, at the same time, attend on the means of
grace, which God has ordained for that purpose: Or, do we
pray for assurance of the love of God, and that spiritual comfort
which is the result thereof? we must be diligent in the
performance of the work of self-examination; or else we are
not to expect that God will answer our prayers.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, Sometimes God delays to answer our prayers, because
we have not given him the glory of former mercies; or
else he designs hereby to try our patience, whether we are not
only inclined to wait upon him, but to wait for him; as the
prophet says, <i>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the
tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what
I shall answer when I am reproved</i>, Hab. ii. 1. So the Psalmist
says, <i>As the eye of servants look unto the hands of their masters,
and the eyes of a maiden unto the hands of her mistress;
so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have
mercy upon us</i>, Psal. cxxiii. 2. And elsewhere the Psalmist,
though he was in great <i>depths</i>, and stood in need of an immediate
answer, when he cried unto the Lord; yet he determines
to <i>wait for him</i>, and <i>hope in his word</i>; that is, while he is expecting
a mercy, he does not despair of having it in the end,
because he depends on God’s word of promise; but yet he
resolves to <i>wait as those that watch for the morning</i>, Psal.
cxxx. 1, 5, 6, which contains a mixture of two graces, namely,
patiently waiting, and yet earnestly desiring the blessing expected.
This is our indispensable duty, whereby we glorify
God, as being sensible that it is not for us to prescribe to him,
when he should fulfil our desires: Whereas we should say,
with Jacob, <i>I will not let thee go, except thou bless me</i>, Gen.
xxxii. 26. I will persevere in prayer till thou art pleased to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>give me all the blessings I stand in need of, and bring me into
that state in which I shall be satisfied with thy goodness, and
my imperfect prayers turned into endless praises.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXXXVI., CLXXXVII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXXVI.</span> <i>What rule hath God given for our direction
in the duty of prayer?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The whole word of God is of use to direct us in the
duty of praying; but the special rule of direction, is that
form of prayer, which our Saviour Christ taught his disciples,
commonly called the Lord’s prayer.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXXVII.</span> <i>How is the Lord’s prayer to be used?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The Lord’s prayer is not only for direction, as a pattern,
according to which we are to make other prayers, but
may also be used as a prayer, so that it be done with understanding,
faith, reverence, and other graces necessary to
the right performance of the duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to what is said in the former of these answers, concerning
the word of God, being a rule for our direction in
prayer, it may be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. That we need some direction in order to our performing
this duty; for man is naturally a stranger both to God and
himself. He knows but little of the glorious perfections of
the divine nature, and is not duly sensible of the guilt which
he contracts, or of the mercies which he receives; and without
the knowledge hereof, we shall be at a loss as to the matter
of the duty which we are to engage in. It is certain, many
have a general notion of religion, or of some moral duties,
which they are sensible of their being obliged to perform:
Nevertheless, they cannot address themselves to God in such
a manner as he requires; so that it may truly be said of them,
that <i>they cannot order their speech by reason of darkness</i>, Job
xxxvii. 19. We find that the disciples themselves, who were
intimately conversant with Christ, and, as it must be supposed,
often joined with him in prayer, were, notwithstanding, at a
loss, as to this duty; and therefore they say, <i>Lord teach us to
pray, as John also taught his disciples</i>, Luke xi. 1.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. It is farther observed, that the word of God is to be
made use of for our direction in prayer. This is evident, inasmuch
as we are to ask for nothing but what is agreeable to
his revealed will, which is contained therein; and no one, who
is well acquainted with it, will have reason to say, that he
wants sufficient matter for prayer. This is a very useful head,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>and therefore we shall consider several things which occur to
us in scripture; which ought to be improved, in order to our
direction and assistance in the performance of this duty.
And,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The historical parts of scripture, which contain an account
of the providences of God in the world, and the church,
may be of use for our direction in prayer, as we are to pray,
not only for ourselves, but for others: Therefore his former
dealings with his people, will furnish us with matter accommodated
to our present observation of the necessities of the
church of God in our day: Accordingly we find,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That the sins which a professing people have committed,
have been followed with many terrible instances of the divine
wrath and vengeance: Thus we have an account, of the
universal apostacy of the world from God, which occasioned
their being destroyed by a flood; and the unnatural lusts of
the inhabitants of Sodom, for which they were consumed by
fire from heaven; and of the idolatry and other abominations
committed by the Israelites, for which it is said, that <i>God was
wroth, and greatly abhorred them</i>; upon which they were exposed
to many temporal and spiritual judgments, so that, as
the Psalmist says, <i>he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent
which he placed among men; and delivered his strength into captivity,
and his glory into the enemies hand</i>, Psal. lxxviii. 59-61.
From hence we may take occasion to enquire, whether we
have not been guilty of sins equally great, and, it may be, of
the same kind, which are to be confessed, and the judgments
which have ensued to be deprecated by us? And when we
read in the New Testament, of some flourishing churches,
planted by the apostles, in the beginning of the gospel dispensation,
that have nothing left but a sad remembrance of the
privileges which they once enjoyed; in whom, what Christ
says, concerning his removing <i>his candlestick out of its place</i>,
was soon fulfilled, Rev. iii. 15. This is of use for our direction
in prayer, that he would keep his church and people from
running into the same sins, and exposing themselves to the
same judgments.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We have an account, in scripture, of the church’s increase
and preservation, notwithstanding the darkest dispensations
of providence, and the most violent persecutions which it
has met with from its enemies. When it was in hard bondage,
and severely dealt with, in Egypt, it is observed, that
the more the Egyptians <i>afflicted them, the more they multiplied
and grew</i>, Exod. i. 12. and when they have, in all appearance,
been nearest to ruin, God has opened a door for
their deliverance, and oftentimes done great things in their
behalf, which they looked not for. We have also an historical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>account, in scripture, of God’s owning and encouraging his
people, so long as they have kept close to him; and of his visiting
their iniquities with a rod, when backsliding from him;
and, indeed, whatever we read concerning the providences of
God towards particular believers in the Old or New Testament,
the same may be observed therein, which is of very great
use for our direction in prayer; and accordingly their experiences
are recorded for our instruction, and their necessities, that
we may know what to pray for, as far as there is an agreement
between the account we have of them, and what we find
in ourselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The word of God, as it is a rule of faith, contains those
great doctrines, without the knowledge whereof, we cannot
pray aright. Thus we have an account in scripture, not only
of the Being and perfections of God, which may be known by
the light of nature, but of those glorious truths which cannot
be known but by divine revelation: And,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Of the personal glory of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost; of the Father’s giving all spiritual blessings to his
people, in and through a Mediator; and the Son is considered
as invested in this office and character, and, as God incarnate
procuring for us, by his obedience and death, forgiveness of
sins, and a right to eternal life. We have also an account of
the Holy Ghost, as being a divine person, and therefore equal
with the Father and Son; yet as subservient to them in his
method of acting, as the application of redemption attains the
end of the purchase thereof, in like manner as the purchase of
it was a means to bring about that <i>purpose and grace which
was given us in Christ before the world began</i>, 2 Tim. i. 9.
These doctrines are necessary to direct us in those things
which respect the distinct glory which we are to give to the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and the method in which we
are to hope for the blessings which we ask for in prayer.
Thus the apostle, speaking of this duty, supposes that we are
acquainted with this doctrine, when he says, <i>Through him</i>,
that is, Christ, <i>we have an access by one Spirit unto the Father</i>,
Eph. ii. 18.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) In the word of God, we have not only an account of
the works of nature and providence, or God’s being the Creator
and Governor of the world, which we have some knowledge of,
in a method of reasoning from the divine perfections; but we
have an account therein of those works which have an immediate
reference to our salvation, and that special providence in
which God expresses a greater regard to the heirs of salvation
than to all the world besides: When we draw nigh to God in
prayer, we are not barely to consider him as the God to whom
we owe our being, as men, but our well-being as christians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>delivered from that ruin which we brought on ourselves, by
our apostacy from him; and also, <i>what is the exceeding greatness
of his power to us-ward, who believe, according to the
working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ,
when he raised him from the dead</i>, chap. i. 18, 19. as the apostle
expresses it in that affectionate prayer put up for the church
at Ephesus. And when we survey the works of providence,
we are not barely to think of God as the Governor of the world
in general, but to consider what have been those special acts
of providence, by which he has governed man before and since
the fall, and to consider the first covenant as made with him
in innocency; and the covenant of grace, as being a dispensation
of grace, established in and with Christ, as the Head of
the elect, in order to their being delivered from that state of
sin and misery into which they had brought themselves. These
doctrines will be of use for our direction in prayer, as hereby
we are led to acknowledge our fallen state, what we were by
nature, and what we should have been, had we been left in
that state; and hereby we are also led to adore the riches of
God’s grace, as he brings the greatest good to his saints out
of the greatest evil.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) The word of God gives us a distinct account of the offices
in which Christ is invested, as they are suited to the necessities
of his people, which is a means for our direction concerning
what we are to ask for, with a particular relation to
each of them, and the hope we have that he will grant our request.
As he is appointed by the Father, to be our High
Priest, to make atonement for sin; our Advocate, to plead
our cause; our Prophet, to lead us in the way of salvation;
and our King, to subdue us to himself, and defend us from the
assaults of our spiritual enemies. So we are, in our prayers,
to improve these discoveries which we have thereof, as a
means to direct us in those things which are the subject-matter
both of prayer and praise.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The word of God is of use for our direction in prayer, as
we have an account therein of those duties which are to be
performed by us as men, or christians, in every condition of
life, and in all those relations which we stand in to one another.
As for that which is matter of duty in general, or that obedience
which we owe to God, this cannot be performed but by
his assistance; which is humbly to be asked in prayer: And
accordingly we are to say as one does, Lord, work in me that
which thou requirest, and then require what thou pleasest.
Here we might shew how all the duties which God has commanded,
may be of use to direct us in prayer: that hereby we
may be led to apply ourselves to him, that he would enable us
to perform them; and all the sins forbidden in scripture, may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>be of use to instruct us what to deprecate, when we pray that
God would keep us from our own iniquities, and what we are
to confess before him, and implore the forgiveness of; and all
those commands which respect instituted worship, <i>viz.</i> our attendance
on the ordinances, or the exercise of various graces
therein, in the whole course of our conversation: These are
of use for our direction in prayer, as hereby we know what to
ask for, with relation thereunto; and particularly as to what
concerns the advantage we hope to receive, under the means
of grace, whenever we draw nigh to God in the way which he
has appointed.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. As the word of God contains many promises and predictions,
together with their accomplishment, for the encouragement
of our faith and hope in prayer, it is of use to direct us in
the performance of this duty. As for the predictions that are
fulfilled, so far as they respect the blessings which God designed
to bestow on his church, they are equivalent to promises, and
we are to take occasion from thence, to adore and magnify his
faithfulness; and hope that whatever remains to be done for
us, or his people in general, shall, in like manner, have its accomplishment,
which will afford matter of encouragement to
us in addressing ourselves to him for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The promises which are contained in scripture, are also a motive
and inducement to prayer. These are a declaration of
God’s will to give the blessings, which he sees necessary for us,
and therefore are of great use in order to our performing this
duty aright. Thus God gives an intimation of the great things
that he will do for, or bestow upon his people, when he says, in
Jer. xxxi. 33. <i>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write
it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be
people</i>: and there are many expressions of the like nature,
which contain the form of a promise. But besides these,
there are others which are equivalent to, and may be applied by
us in like manner as though they were laid down in the same
form, as the promises generally are; as,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) When God is said, in his word, to be able to do his people
good, or bestow some particular blessings upon them, this
gives them ground to conclude, that he will do it, or that his
power shall be engaged in their behalf: Thus God is said, in
Jude, ver. 24. to be <i>able to keep</i> them <i>from falling, and to present
them faultless before the presence of his glory with
exceeding joy</i>. And elsewhere it is said, 2 Cor. ix. 8. that <i>God is
able to make all grace abound towards</i> his people, <i>that</i> they <i>always
having all-sufficiency in all things, may abound to every
good work</i>: This is the same as though it had been said, that he
would do this for them.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) When God is said to glorify any of his perfections in giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>those blessings that his people want, this is also equivalent to
a promise: Thus, in Exod. xxxiv. 4, 6. when <i>the Lord passed
by before Moses, and proclaimed the Lord God, merciful and gracious,
long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth</i>, &amp;c. it
is the same as though he had said that he would shew mercy
to them, since the design thereof is to encourage them to hope
for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Whatever blessings are said to be purchased by Christ
as our Redeemer, or prayed for by him as our Advocate, these
may be included in the number of promised blessings; for they
will certainly be applied by him, who will not lose what he has
purchased by his blood, and is never denied what he asks for.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) The universal experience of believers, relating to the
blessings that accompany salvation, contains the nature, though
not the form, of a promise; and therefore, when this is recorded
in scripture, for the encouragement of others, in all succeeding
ages, it is as much to be applied by us when we are in like circumstances
as though it were more directly promised to us:
Thus when God’s faithful servants are said, 1 Pet. i. 5. to be
<i>kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation</i>; or,
when the Psalmist says, in Psal. xxxvii. 25. <i>I have been young,
and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor
his seed begging bread</i>; these, and such-like expressions, are
to be applied by us as promises.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) That which is proposed to us, or which we are to have
in view, as the end of our attending on ordinances, is equivalent
to a promise; and accordingly, when we are commanded
or encouraged to hope and pray for any spiritual blessings,
when waiting upon God therein, in such a way as he requires,
it is the same thing as though he had said, that he would give
us those blessings. If a believer is thirsty, and encouraged to
come to the waters; or if he wants grace or peace, and is told
that these are to be attained in ordinances, the bare intimation
that we are to seek these blessings in such a way is equivalent
to a promise.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) God’s seeing our distress or knowing our wants, is sometimes
to be understood in scripture, as containing the nature of
a promise, relating to the supply thereof: Thus our Saviour
tells his disciples, in Matt. vi. 32. <i>Your heavenly Father knoweth
that ye have need of all these things</i>; which is the same as
though he had told them, that God had promised or designed
to bestow those outward blessings upon them: And when he
designed, or promised to deliver his people out of the bondage,
in which they were in Egypt, he says, <i>I have surely
seen the affliction of my people: I know their sorrows</i>, &amp;c.
Exod. iii. 7. Thus concerning the manner in which the promises
are laid down in scripture.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>We shall now consider how they are to be made use of in
order to our direction and encouragement in prayer. And
here it may be observed, that the promises either respect outward,
or spiritual blessings, both of which we are to pray for:
Thus the apostle says, in 1 Tim. iv. 8. <i>Godliness has the promise
of the life that now is, and of that which is to come</i>; the
former respects the temporal dispensations of providence; the
latter, grace and glory, or the things that accompany salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] We shall consider the promises that respect temporal or
outward blessings which we are obliged to pray for, as we
stand in need of them. These are of various kinds;</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, There are promises of health and strength, whereby our
passage through this world may be made easy and comfortable,
and we better enabled to glorify God therein: Thus it is
said, in Prov. iii. 7, 8. <i>Fear the Lord, and depart from evil.
It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</i> And
in Psal. ciii. 5. <i>Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so
that thy youth is renewed like the eagles.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, There are promises of food and raiment, or the necessary
provisions and conveniences of life, in Psal. xxxvii. 3.
<i>Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the
land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</i> And in Deut. x. 18. <i>He
doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and
loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, There are promises of comfort and peace in our dwellings,
in Job v. 24. ‘Thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall
be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not
sin.’ And, in Psal. xci. 10. ‘There shall no evil befal thee, neither
shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.’ And in
Psal. cxxi. 8. ‘The Lord shalt preserve thy going out, and
thy coming in, from this time forth and forevermore.’</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, There are promises of quiet and composed rest by
night, on our beds, in Job xi. 18, 19. <i>Thou shalt take thy rest
in safety: Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee
afraid.</i> And in Prov. iii. 24. <i>When thou liest down, thou
shalt not be afraid; yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall
be sweet.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>5thly</i>, There are promises of success, and a blessing to attend
us in our worldly callings, in Psal. cxxviii. 2. <i>Thou shalt
eat the labour of thine hands: Happy shalt thou be, and it shall
be well with thee.</i> And in Deut. xxviii. 4, 5, 12. ‘Blessed
shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground,
the fruit of thy cattle, and the increase of thy kine, and the
flocks of thy sheep. Blessed shall be thy basket and thy
store. The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure, the
heaven to give the rain unto thy land, in his season, and to
bless all the work of thine hand: And thou shalt lend unto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>many nations, and shalt not borrow.’ And in Psal. i. 3. ‘He
shall be like a tree, planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth
forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither,
and whatsoever he doth shall prosper.’</p>

<p class='c006'><i>6thly</i>, There are promises of an intail of blessings on our families,
in Psal. cxxviii. 3. ‘Thy wife shall be as a fruitful
vine, by the sides of thine house; thy children like olive-plants
round about thy table.’ And, in Psal. ciii. 17. ‘The
mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting, upon
them that fear him; and his righteousness unto children’s
children.’ And, in Psal. cii. 28. ‘The children of thy
servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before
thee.’ And, in Psal. xlv. 16. ‘Instead of thy fathers
shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all
the earth.’</p>

<p class='c006'>I might have mentioned many more promises of outward
blessings, which God will bestow on his people, though with
this limitation, so far as it may be for his glory, and their real
good, viz. such as respect riches, as in Psal. cxii. 3. ‘Wealth
and riches shall be in his house; and his righteousness endureth
for ever;’ or honours, as in 1 Sam. ii. 30. and these
accompanied with long life; as, in Prov. iii. 17. ‘Length
of days are in her right hand; and in her left hand riches
and honour.’ And, in Psal. xxxiv. 12, 13. ‘What man is
he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see
good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking
guile;’ or, if God does not think fit to give them this, he
will take them out of the world in mercy, and gather them into
a better, to prevent their seeing the evil he designs to bring on
the inhabitants thereof, Isa. lvii. 1. ‘The righteous is taken
away from the evil to come.’ He has also promised some
blessings that respect their good name, in Zeph. iii. 20. ‘I
will make you a name and a praise among all people of
the earth.’ And in Prov. x. 7. ‘The memory of the just is
blessed.’ But that which I shall principally add concerning
these and such-like outward blessings, is, that God has not
only promised, that he will give them to his people, but that
he will sanctify them to them for their spiritual advantage, and
enable them to improve them aright to his glory, which will
render them more sweet and desirable to them. Thus God
has promised,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That he will free his people, who enjoy outward good
things, from the sorrow which is oftentimes mixed therewith,
and tends greatly to imbitter them, in Prov. x. 22. ‘The
blessing of the Lord maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow
with it.’ He has also promised to give them inward peace,
together with outward prosperity, in Psal. xxxvii. 11. ‘The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in
the abundance of peace.’</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, He has promised to give them spiritual and heavenly
blessings, together with the good things of this life, in Job xxii.
24-26. ‘Thou shalt lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir
as the stones of the brooks. Yea, the Almighty shall be thy
defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver: For then shalt
thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy
face unto God.’ And in Psal. xxiii. 5, 6. ‘Thou preparest
a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou
anointest mine head with oil, my cup runneth over. Surely
goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life;
and I will, or, I shall, dwell in the house of the Lord for
ever.’</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, God has promised together with outward blessings, to
give a thankful heart, whereby his people may be enabled to
give him the glory thereof, in Deut. viii. 10. ‘When thou
hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord thy
God, for the good land which he hath given thee.’ And, in
Joel ii. 26. ‘Ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise
the name of the Lord your God, that hath dealt wondrously
with you; and my people shall never be ashamed.’</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, He has not only promised that he will confer outward
good things on his people, but that he will make them
blessings to others, and thereby enable them to lay out what
he gives them for their good, to support his cause and gospel
in the world; and to relieve those that are in distress, in Gen.
xii. 2. ‘I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou
shalt be a blessing.’ And, in Deut. xxvi. 11. ‘Thou shalt
rejoice in every good thing which the Lord thy God hath
given unto thee and unto thine house, thou and the Levite,
and the stranger that is among you.’ These promises more
especially respect those who are in a prosperous condition in
the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there are others which are made to believers, in an afflicted
state; and, indeed, there is scarce any affliction which
they are liable to, but what has some special promises annexed
to it. Accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) There are promises made to them when lying on a sick
bed, in Psal. xli. 5. ‘The Lord will strengthen him upon the
bed of languishing; thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.’
And, in Deut. vii. 15. ‘The Lord will take from thee
all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt
(which thou knowest) upon thee; but will lay them upon all
that hate thee.’ And, in Exod. xxiii. 25. ‘I will take sickness
away from the midst of thee.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) There are other promises made to believers, when poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>and low in this world, in Psal. cxxxii. 15. ‘I will abundantly
bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) There are other promises that respect God’s giving a
full compensation for all the losses which his people have sustained
for Christ’s sake, in Matt. xix. 29. ‘Every one that
hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or
mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my name’s sake,
shall receive an hundred-fold, and shall inherit life everlasting.’
And, in chap. x. 39. ‘He that findeth his life shall
lose it; and he that loseth his life for my name’s sake shall
find it.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) There are other promises made to believers under oppression,
in Psal. xii. 5. ‘For the oppression of the poor, for
the sighing of the needy, now will I arise (saith the Lord)
I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.’ And
in Hos. xiv. 3. ‘In thee the fatherless findeth mercy.’ And, in
Psal. lxviii. 5. ‘A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the
widows, is God in his holy habitation.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) There are other promises made to believers, when reviled
and persecuted for righteousness’ sake, Matt. v. 11, 12,
‘Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you,
and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my
sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great is your
reward in heaven.’ And, in 1 Pet. iv. 19. ‘Wherefore
let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit the
keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful
Creator.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) There are promises made to God’s people, when they
are in distress, and, at present, see no way of escape: Thus
when Jeremiah was shut up in the court of the prison, he had
this promise given him, in Jer. xxxiii. 3. ‘Call unto me, and I
will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things,
which thou knowest not.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(7.) God has made promises suited to the condition of his
people, when their lot is cast in perilous times: Thus it is said,
in Isa. xliii. 2. <i>When thou passest through the waters, I will
be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow
thee: When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burnt;
neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Now there are several mercies which God has promised to
his people, under the various afflictions which we are exposed
to, as,</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>1st</i>,) Sometimes he promises to prevent the afflictions which
we are most afraid of, in Psal. cxxi. 7. ‘The Lord shall preserve
thee from all evils; he shall preserve thy soul.’ And, in
Job v. 19. ‘He shall deliver thee in six troubles; yea, in seven
there shall no evil touch thee.’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>(<i>2d</i>,) He has promised to preserve his people from, or defend
them in, a time of trouble, in Gen. xv. 1. ‘Fear not Abram:
I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.’ And, in
Ezek. xi. 16. ‘Thus saith the Lord; although I have cast them
far off among the heathen; and although I have scattered
them among the countries, yet will I be to them a little sanctuary
in the countries where they shall come.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>3d</i>,) He has promised to moderate their afflictions, in Isa.
xxvii. 8. ‘In measure when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate
with it; he stayeth his rough wind in the day of his east
wind.’ And, in Jer. xlvi. 28. ‘Fear thou not, O Jacob, my
servant, saith the Lord, for I am with thee, for I will make a
full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee, but I
will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure;
yet I will not leave thee wholly unpunished.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>4th</i>,) He has also promised, that if need be, he will shorten
the affliction, in Psal. cxxv. 3. ‘The rod of the wicked shall
not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put
forth their hands unto iniquity.’ And, in Mark xiii. 19, 20.
‘In those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning
of the creation: And except that the Lord had shortened
those days, no flesh could be saved; but for the elect’s
sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>5th</i>,) God has also promised his people that he will enable
them to bear those afflictions which he lays upon them, in Psal.
xxxvii. 24. ‘Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down;
for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.’ And, in 2 Cor.
xii. 9. ‘He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for
my strength is made perfect in weakness.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>6th.</i>) He has promised to shew his people the particular sin
that is the cause of the affliction, that they may be humbled
for it, in Job xxxvi. 8, 9. ‘If they be bound in fetters, and
be holden in cords of affliction; then he sheweth them their
work and their transgressions that they have exceeded.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>7th.</i>) He has promised to bring good to them out of their
afflictions, in Isa. xxvii. 9. ‘By this therefore shall the iniquity
of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away
his sin.’ And in Psal. xcvii. 11. ‘light is sown for the
righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.’ And in
Zech. xiii. 9. ‘I will bring the third part through the fire, and
will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold
is tried: They shall call on my name, and I will hear them:
I will say, that it is my people; and they shall say, Thou art
my God.’ Thus concerning the promises that more especially
respect outward blessings which God bestows on his people.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] There are other promises contained in scripture, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>relate more especially to spiritual blessings, which are of great
use to us, when we are asking them of God in prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, There are promises that relate more especially to the
ordinances or means of grace: These are various,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Some respect the duty of prayer, and also the event and
success that shall attend it, in God’s giving gracious returns,
or answers thereof, in Psal. xci. 15. ‘He shall call upon me,
and I will answer him.’ And in Jer. xxix. 12, 13. ‘Then
shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and
I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me, and find me,
when ye shall search for me with all your heart.’ And, in
Psal. l. 15. ‘Call upon me, in the day of trouble, I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify me.’</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Another ordinance to which promises are also annexed,
is meditation about spiritual things, in Prov. xiv. 22. ‘Mercy
and truth shall be to them that devise good.’ And, in Josh.
i. 8. ‘This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth,
but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou
mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein;
for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou
shalt have good success.’ There are also promises made to
those who read the word of God, to wit, that he will make
known his words to them, so that they may understand them,
Prov. i. 23. ‘Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour
out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto
you.’</p>

<p class='c006'>3. There are promises made to those who attend on the
public worship of God, in Psal. xxxvi. 8, 9. ‘They shall be
abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou
shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.’ And,
in Psal. cxxviii. 5. ‘The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion;
and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy
life.’</p>

<p class='c006'>4. There are promises made to religious fasting on special
occasions, as in Mat. vi. 17. ‘When thou fastest, anoint thine
head, and wash thy face; that thou appear not unto men to
fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father
which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.’</p>

<p class='c006'>5. There are promises made to alms-giving, in Prov. xi. 25.
‘The liberal soul shall be made fat; and he that watereth shall
be watered also himself.’ And, in Eccl. xi. 1. ‘Cast thy bread
upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days.’—And
in 2 Cor. ix. 6, 7, 8. ‘He which soweth bountifully shall
also reap bountifully: God loveth a cheerful giver, and is
able to make all grace abound, <i>&amp;c.</i>’</p>

<p class='c006'>6. There are promises made to believers, when they appear
in the behalf of truth, at those times when it is opposed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>perverted, that by this means it may not be run down, nor
they confounded, or put to silence by its enemies, Luke xxi.
15. ‘I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries
shall not be able to gainsay, nor resist.’</p>

<p class='c006'>7. There are promises made to the religious and strict observation
and sanctification of the Lord’s day, Isa. lvi. 2.
‘Blessed is the man that doth this; that keepeth the Sabbath
from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.’</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, There are promises, contained in scripture, which
respect God’s giving his people special grace, together with
that joy, peace and comfort that flows from it, which will be of
great use to them, in order to their engaging aright in the duty
of prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. There are promises of the grace of faith, and others that
are made to it; as it is said, in John vi. 37. ‘All that the Father
giveth to me shall come to me; and him that cometh to
me I will in no wise cast out.’ And, in Eph. ii. 8. ‘By grace
are ye saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves; it
is the gift of God.’</p>

<p class='c006'>2. There are promises of the grace of repentance, in Rom.
xi. 26. ‘There shall come out of Zion the deliverer, and shall
turn away ungodliness from Jacob.’ And, in Ezek. xx. 43.
‘Ye shall remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein
ye have been defiled, and ye shall lothe yourselves in your
own sight, for all your evils that ye have committed.’</p>

<p class='c006'>3. There are promises of love to God: Thus in Gal. v. 2.
‘The fruit of the Spirit is love.’ And, 2 Tim. i. 7. ‘God
hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and love,
and of a sound mind.’ And, in Rom. v. 5. ‘Hope maketh
not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts, by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.’ And, in
2 Thes. iii. 5. ‘The Lord direct your hearts into the love of
God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.’</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Another grace promised is an holy filial fear of God, in
Jer. xxx. 39, 40. ‘I will give them one heart, and one way,
that they may fear them for ever, for the good of them, and
of their children after them. And I will make an everlasting
covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to
do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that
they shall not depart from me.’ And, in Hos. iii. 5. ‘They
shall fear the Lord and his goodness.’</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Obedience to God’s commands, which is an indispensable
duty, is also considered as a promised blessing, in Deut. xxx.
8. ‘Thou shalt return and obey the voice of the Lord, and do
all his commandments which I command thee this day.’</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, as there are promises of the graces of the Spirit,
so the comforts that flow from thence are also promised: Thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>it is said in Isa. li. 12. <i>I, even I, am he that comforteth you.</i>
And, in chap. xl. 1. <i>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people: Speak
ye comfortably to Jerusalem</i>, &amp;c. more particularly,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) There are promises of peace of conscience, which is a
great branch of those spiritual comforts which God gives his
people ground to expect: Thus it is said in Isa. lvii. 18, 19.
‘I will restore comforts unto him, and to his mourners. I
create the fruit of the lips; peace, peace to him that is afar
off, and to him that is near, saith the Lord.’ And, in chap.
xxvi. 4. ‘Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is
stayed on thee; because he trusteth in thee.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) God has promised a good hope of eternal life, in 2 Thes.
ii. 16. ‘Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even
our Father, who hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting
consolation, and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts.’
And, in Rom. xv. 4. ‘Whatsoever things were written aforetime
were written for our learning; that we through patience
and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) God has promised spiritual joy to his people, in Psal.
lxiv. 10. ‘The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall
trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.’ And,
in Psal. xcvii. 11, 12. ‘Light is sown for the righteous, and
gladness for the upright in heart. Rejoice in the Lord ye
righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.’</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we shall consider a believer, when drawing nigh to
God in prayer, as depressed and bowed in his own spirit, and
hardly able to speak a word to him in his own behalf, as the
Psalmist says, in Psal. lxxvii. 3, 4. <i>I complained and my spirit
was overwhelmed. I am so troubled that I cannot speak</i>; and
how he may receive great advantage from those promises
which he will find in the word of God; as,</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>1st</i>,) When he complains of the wickedness, hardness and
perverseness of his heart; in this case God has promised, in
Ezek. xi. 19. ‘I will put a new spirit within you, and I will
take the stony heart out of your flesh, and will give you an
heart of flesh.’ And, in Jer. xxiii. 29. ‘Is not my word like
a fire, saith the Lord, and like a hammer that breaketh the
rock in pieces.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>2d</i>,) When a believer is sensible of his ignorance, or, at
least, that his knowledge of divine truths bears no proportion
to the means of grace, which he has been favoured with, and
that he is often destitute of spiritual wisdom, to direct his way,
and carry him through the difficulties he often meets with, as
to what concerns his temporal or spiritual affairs: There are
promises suited to this case, in Prov. ii. 3-6. ‘If thou criest
after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>if thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her, as for hid
treasures; then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord;
and find the knowledge of God.’ And in James i. 5. ‘If
any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth
to all men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given
him.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>3d</i>,) If they complain of the weakness of their memories,
that they cannot retain the truths of God when they hear them;
Christ has promised, in John xiv. 26. that the Holy Ghost
shall <i>teach</i> them <i>all things, and bring all things to their remembrance</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>4th</i>,) If they complain of their unthankfulness, or that they
have not hearts disposed to praise God for the mercies they
receive, he has promised, in Isa. 21. <i>This people have I formed
for myself, they shall shew forth my praise.</i> And, in Psal.
cxl. 14. <i>Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name,
the upright shall dwell in thy presence.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>5th</i>,) There are many who are not altogether destitute of
hope that they have the truth of grace, but yet are filled with
trouble, as apprehending that they do not make those advances,
in grace, as they ought, but seem to be at a stand, which they
can reckon little other than going backward, and they dread
the consequences thereof; such may take encouragement from
those promises that respect a believer’s growing in grace; as
it is said, in John viii. 7. <i>Though thy beginning was small,
yet thy latter end shall greatly increase.</i> And, in Isa. xl. 29,
31. <i>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no
might, he increaseth strength. They that wait upon the Lord
shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as
eagles, they shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk and
not faint.</i> And if they complain of their unprofitableness under
the means of grace, and not receiving any spiritual advantage
by the various dispensations of providence which they are
under; there is a promise adapted to this case, in Isa. xlviii.
17. <i>Thus saith the Lord thy Redeemer, the holy One of Israel,
I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit, which
leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>6th</i>) Are they afraid that they shall fall away after having
made a long profession of religion? There is a promise which
our Saviour himself took encouragement from, though never
liable to any fear of this nature, which a believer may apply
to himself, as affording relief against these fears and discouragements,
in Psal. xvi. 8. ‘I have set the Lord always before
me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.’
And there is another which is more directly applicable
to this case, in 1 Cor. i. 8. ‘Who shall also confirm you
unto the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>Jesus Christ.’ And if he is fallen, and, at the same time,
afraid that he shall never be able to rise again, and recover
what he has lost, there is another promise in Psal. xxxvi. 24,
28. ‘Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for
the Lord upholdeth him with his hand. The Lord loveth
judgment, and forsaketh not his saints:’ And God also
says, in Heb. xiii. 5. ‘I will never leave thee, nor forsake
thee.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>7th</i>,) If a believer be under divine desertion, which he
may be, and yet kept from apostacy; if he is mourning after
the Lord, and earnestly desiring that he would return to him;
he may take encouragement from that promise in Psal. xlii.
5. ‘Why art thou cast down, O my soul; and why art thou
disquieted in me? hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise
him for the help of his countenance.’ And, in Jer. xxxi.
13, 14. ‘Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both
young men and old together: For I will turn their mourning
into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice
from their sorrow. And I will satiate the soul of the priests
with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness,
saith the Lord.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>8th</i>,) Is he cast down under a sense of the guilt of sin,
and afraid of the punishment that will ensue? there are many
promises in the word of God that respect the forgiveness of
sin, in Psal. ciii. 3. ‘Who forgiveth all thine iniquities: who
healeth all thy diseases.’ And, in Psal. cxxx. 4. ‘There is
forgiveness with thee, that thou mayst be feared.’ And, in
Isa. xliii. 25. ‘I, even I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions
for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.’</p>

<p class='c006'>(<i>9th</i>,) Is a believer afraid of the last enemy, death, by reason
of the <i>fear</i> whereof <i>he is all his life-time subject to bondage</i>:
Heb. ii. 15. and Psal. xlviii. 14. ‘This God is our
God for ever and ever; he will be our guide even unto
death.’ And, in Psal. xxiii. 4. ‘Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for
thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.’
And, in Psal. xxxvii. 37. ‘Mark the perfect man, and behold
the upright; for the end of that man is peace.’ Thus we have
considered the promises of God as suited to every condition,
and, consequently, as affording matter of encouragement to us
in drawing nigh to him in prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Those reproofs for sins committed, and threatenings which
are contained in the word of God, as a means to deter from
committing them, may be improved for our direction in prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) As we are hereby induced to hate sin, beg strength to
subdue and mortify it, and deprecate the wrath and judgments
of God against those that commit it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>(2.) We are hereby led to see our desert of punishment,
while we confess ourselves to be sinners, and to bless God that
he has not inflicted it upon us; but especially if he has given
us ground of hope that he has delivered us from that condemnation
which was due to us for sin.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) They will be of use to us in prayer, as we are thereby
led to have an awful sense of the holiness and justice of God,
and to draw nigh to him with fear and trembling, lest we should
provoke his wrath by our unbecoming behaviour in his presence,
and thereby bring on ourselves a curse instead of a blessing.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. The word of God is of use for our direction in prayer,
as it contains many examples of the performance of this duty
in a right manner by the saints, whose graces, and the manner
in which they have drawn nigh to God, are proposed for our
imitation in this duty: Thus we read of Jacob’s wrestling with
God, and his great importunity, when it is said, in Hos. xii.
4. ‘He had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept and
made supplication unto him;’ as referring to what is mentioned
in Gen. xxxii. 26, 28. ‘The angel,’ that is, Christ, says,
‘let me go, for the day breaketh,’ <i>q. d.</i> cease thy importunity,
which thou hast maintained to the breaking of the day; during
which time I have given thee no encouragement that I will
grant thy request. Jacob persists in his resolution, and says,
‘I will not let thee go, except thou bless me;’ that is, I will
not leave off importuning thee, till thou givest me a gracious
answer: Upon which, our Saviour says, ‘as a prince hast thou
power with God,’ that is, with me, ‘and with men,’ to wit,
with Esau thy brother, ‘and hast prevailed:’ So that he shall
do thee no hurt, in ver. 28. but his heart shall be turned toward
thee.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, we read of Abraham’s humility in prayer, when he
says, in Gen. xviii. 27. ‘Behold now, I have taken upon me
to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes.’ And,
in ver. 30. ‘Oh! let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak.’</p>

<p class='c006'>We also read of David’s sincerity, in Psal. xvii. 1. ‘Attend
unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer that goeth not out of
feigned lips;’ and of Hezekiah’s addressing himself to God
with tears in his sickness; upon which, he immediately received
a gracious answer, in Isa. xxxviii 3, 5. and when he
was recovered, he gives praise to God, in ver. 19. ‘The living,
the living, he shall praise thee as I do this day: The Father
to the children shall make known thy truth.’</p>

<p class='c006'>We have an instance of Jonah’s faith in prayer, when his
disobedience to the divine command, had brought him into the
utmost distress, in Jonah ii. 2, 4. ‘Out of the belly of hell cried
I, and thou heardest my voice. Then I said, I am cast out
of thy sight; yet will I look again toward thy holy temple.’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>We have also an instance of Daniel’s drawing nigh to God
with an uncommon reverence, and awful fear of his divine
Majesty, and an account of the manner in which he addresses
himself to him, with confession of those sins which Israel had
been guilty of, in Dan. ix. 4, 5. ‘I prayed unto the Lord my
God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great
and dreadful God, keeping the covenant, and mercy to them
that love him, and to them that keep his commandments:
We have sinned, and committed iniquity, and have done
wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts,
and from thy judgments.’ And we have this humble
confession and supplication, continued to ver. 19. and then an
account of the success thereof, in the gracious answer that
God sent him by an angel from heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>We also read of Joshua’s interceding for Israel, when he
‘fell upon his face before the ark of the Lord, with his clothes
rent,’ Josh. vii. 6. and we have the plea that he makes use of
in ver. 9. ‘What wilt thou do unto thy great name.’</p>

<p class='c006'>We have also an instance of fervency in Moses, (when pleading
for the people, after they had worshipped the golden calf,)
who prefers God’s glory to his own happiness; and had rather
have no name in the church, or be <i>blotted out of the book which</i>
God had <i>written</i>, than that his <i>wrath</i> should <i>wax hot against
Israel, to consume them</i>; of which we have an account in Exod.
xxxiii. 10, 11, 31, 32.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c012'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>There are many other instances of this nature mentioned in
scripture; which, for brevity sake, I pass over; and, indeed,
the whole book of the Lamentations is of use to direct us in
prayer, under pressing afflictions, either feared or undergone;
and the book of Psalms is a directory for prayer to the believer,
suited to every condition which he may be supposed to be in,
and of praise for mercies of all kinds, whether temporal or spiritual.
And the same may be said of many other parts of scripture.</p>

<p class='c006'>From what has been said concerning the word of God being
a direction to us in prayer, we may infer,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That, as reading the scriptures in our families and closets,
is a great help to raise our affections, and bring us into a
praying frame: So the application of scripture-doctrines and
examples to our own case, will supply us with fit matter and
expressions upon all occasions, when we draw nigh to God in
this duty.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The pretence of some that they know not how to pray,
or that they cannot do it without a prescribed form, arises, for
the most part, from an unacquaintedness with, or a neglect to
study the scriptures, to answer this end.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>(3.) Since the word of God is a directory for prayer, we
ought not to affect modes of expression, or human strains of
rhetoric, which are not deduced from, or agreeable to scripture;
but, on the other hand, we are to use such a simplicity
of style, and spirituality of expression, as we find contained
therein; especially in those parts thereof, as are more directly
subservient to this duty.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) It will be of very great use for us sometimes, in the
course of our reading scripture, especially in private, to turn
what we read into prayer, though it do not contain in itself the
form of a prayer; as when we read of the presumptuous sins
committed by some, and the visible marks of God’s displeasure
that ensued hereupon, we ought to lift up our hearts to him,
to keep us from them; or, if we have reason to charge ourselves
as guilty of them, that we may be humbled, and obtain
forgiveness from him. And when we read, the excellent characters
of some of the saints, in scripture, we ought to pray
that God would enable us to be followers of them herein; or
when, in some parts thereof, believers are represented as praying
for particular mercies, we ought, at the same time, to lift
up our hearts to God for the same: This will be a means, not
only to furnish us with matter and proper expressions in prayer;
but to excite our affections when we engage in this duty, in
those stated times which are set apart for it. This leads us
to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. That there is a special rule of direction contained in
that form of prayer which Christ taught his disciples, commonly
called <i>the Lord’s prayer</i>. This prayer is mentioned
only by two of the evangelists, <i>viz.</i> Matthew, in chap. vi. 8,—13.
and Luke, in chap. xi. 2, 3, 4. in which we may observe,
that though there be a perfect harmony between them, as there
is between all other parts of scripture, as to the matter or sense
of them; yet it is obvious to all who compare them together,
that there is some difference as to the mode of expression; particularly
as to the <i>fourth</i> and <i>fifth</i> petition, (and that not only
in the translation, as being sufficiently just, but in the original)
which there would not have been, had it been designed for a
form of prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. In the fourth petition, Luke teaches us to say, <i>Give us
day by day our daily bread</i>: Whereas, in Matthew, it is expressed,
<i>Give us this day our daily bread</i>, in which there are
different ideas contained in the respective words. This is very
common, when the same sense, for substance, is laid down in
different parts of scripture.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c012'><sup>[111]</sup></a> <i>Give us this day our daily bread</i>,
contains a petition for what we want at present; and, Give us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span><i>this, day by day</i>, implies, that these wants will daily recur
upon us, in which it will be necessary to desire a supply from
God; and therefore, if both these accounts of this petition be
compared together, we are hereby directed to pray, Lord, give
us the blessings which we want at present; and let these wants be
daily supplied, as we shall stand in need of a supply from thee.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c012'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>2. In the fifth petition, Luke directs us to pray, <i>Forgive us
our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us</i>:
Whereas, in Matthew, the expression is very different, viz.
<i>Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The evangelist Luke leaves out the doxology, <i>For thine
is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen</i>;
which Matthew adds.</p>

<p class='c006'>From hence, I conceive, it may be inferred, that our Saviour’s
design, in dictating this prayer to his people, was not
that they should confine themselves wholly to the mode of expression
used therein, without the least variation; for then,
doubtless, the two Evangelists would have laid it down in the
very same words; but he rather designed it as a directory respecting
the matter of prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am sensible it will be objected to this, that the preface,
which Luke prefixes to it, is, <i>when we pray, say, Our Father</i>,
&amp;c. which seems to intimate that these very words should be
used, and no other: But to this it may be replied, that the
evangelist Matthew, who beyond dispute, laid down this prayer
more fully than Luke does, says, by way of preface to it,
<i>After this manner pray ye</i>; which seems to be an intimation
that it was designed rather to be a directory, as to the matter
of prayer, than a form of words to be used without the least
variation; and therefore I cannot but think, that what Luke
says, <i>when you pray, say</i>, &amp;c. imports nothing else but, <i>pray
after this manner</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It farther appears, that our Saviour principally designed this
prayer as a directory, respecting the matter of our petitions,
rather than a form; because it does not explicitly contain all
the parts of prayer, nor particularly, confession of sin, or thankful
acknowledgment of mercies. I say, it does not contain
these explicitly, but only implicitly, as a deduction, or inference
from the petitions themselves; as when we say, <i>Forgive
us our debts</i>, or sins, this supposes that we acknowledge ourselves
to be sinners. It cannot be denied, but that there are
some expressions which contain matter of thanksgiving; as
when we pray, <i>Hallowed be thy name</i>, it implies, a thankful
acknowledgment of all those instances in which God has sanctified
his name, as well as a desire that he would do it, <i>q. d.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>thou hast, in the various dispensations of thy providence; and
in all thine holy institutions, set forth the glory of thy perfections
that thou mayest be adored and magnified by thy creatures;
this we own with thankfulness at the same time that
we desire the continuance thereof. And when we pray, <i>Give
us daily bread</i>; we do, in effect, acknowledge the bounty of
his providence, from whence we receive all the comforts of
life, and the large share thereof, which he has communicated
to us, whereby our wants have hitherto been supplied. This,
I say, is an implicit direction for thanksgiving. But if our Saviour
had designed that it should be a perfect form of words,
to be used without varying in the least from them, he would
have given us some more full and direct account of what sins
we are to acknowledge, and what mercies we are to thank him
for, which is more plainly contained in some other scriptures,
than it can be supposed to be in this prayer; therefore, it seems
to be principally designed as a rule for our direction what we
are to ask for; or how that part of prayer, which includes in
it petition, ought to be performed, agreeably to the mind and
will of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, there is no explicit mention of the Mediator, in
whose name we are to pray; nor of his obedience, sufferings,
or intercession, on which the efficacy of our prayers is founded,
which our faith is to have a great regard unto. These
things therefore are to be supplied by what we find in other
parts of scripture, all which, taken together, give us a perfect
directory for prayer; though neither this, nor any other prayers
used in scripture, sufficiently appear to have been designed as
a form of words which we are to confine ourselves to, without
the least variation from them.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to what is observed in the latter of the answers, under
our present consideration, <i>viz.</i> that the Lord’s prayer is not
only for direction, as a pattern, but may be used as a prayer,
provided it be done in a right manner. It is granted that the
Lord’s prayer is of use, as a pattern and rule for our direction,
in common with all other prayers contained in scripture; but
the main difficulty relating to this matter, is, whether our Saviour
designed that his disciples, and the church, in all following
ages, should confine themselves to the words thereof, so
far as that the mode of expression should not be, in the least,
altered, or any thing added to the petitions contained therein,
how agreeable soever it be to the sense, and words of scripture.
This does not seem to have been his intention therein;
and, as it will not be denied by any, that every one of the petitions
contained in it, may be interspersed and joined with other
petitions to God in prayer, so, when this has been done,
or, at least, the sense thereof expressed in other words, it will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>be very hard to prove that it is absolutely necessary that these
petitions should be recollected, and prayed over again, in the
same method in which they are laid down in this prayer, barely
for the sake of our making use of it as a form; especially
if this is not expressly commanded by our Saviour, as it does
not sufficiently appear to be, if what was before observed be
true, that those words, <i>When we pray, say, Our Father</i>, &amp;c.
implies nothing else but, <i>pray after this manner</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, I would be very far from censuring or blaming
the practice observed by many of the reformed churches, who
conclude their <i>ex tempore</i>, or premeditated prayers with it, provided
it be done with understanding, reverence, and suitable
acts of faith, as any other petition contained in scripture may
be made use of by us in prayer; not only in words agreeable
thereunto, but in the express words thereof. The principal
thing that I would militate against, is not so much the using
the words, as doing this in a formal way, supposing that the
bare recital of them doth, as it were, sanctify our other prayers;
which, though very agreeable to the sense thereof, are, as
some suppose, rendered so incomplete, that they will hardly be
regarded by God without it. And I cannot but conclude the
Papists highly to blame, who think the frequent repetition of it,
though in a tongue unknown to the common people, is not only
necessary, but, in some measure, meritorious. And the practice
of some ignorant superstitious persons, who think that it
may be made use of as a charm; and that the words thereof
repeated, as the Jews of old did their Phylacteries, as a means
to drive away evil spirits, is not only to be disapproved, but
it is a vile instance of profaneness, very remote from the design
of our Saviour in giving it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CLXXXVIII., CLXXXIX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXXVIII.</span> <i>Of how many parts doth the Lord’s
prayer consist?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The Lord’s prayer consists of three parts, a preface,
petitions, and a conclusion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Quest. CLXXXIX.</span> <i>What doth the preface of the Lord’s prayer
teach us?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The preface of the Lord’s prayer [contained in these
words, <i>Our Father which art in heaven</i>] teacheth us, when
we pray, to draw near to God with confidence of his fatherly
goodness, and our interest therein, with reverence, and all
other child-like dispositions, heavenly affections, and due apprehensions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>of his Sovereign power, majesty, and gracious
condescension; as also to pray with, and for others.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this prayer we are taught to begin our prayers with a
preface, and therein to make an explicit mention of the
name of God, and some of his divine perfections. The preface
to this prayer is contained in these words; <i>Our Father
which art in heaven</i>. In which we may observe, that we are
to draw near to God with reverence, and suitable apprehensions
of his sovereign power, majesty, and other divine perfections,
and with an holy confidence of his fatherly goodness;
and that we are to pray with, and for others, which may be inferred
from his being styled, <i>Our Father</i>; by which we are instructed
to begin our prayers with some expressions of reverence,
agreeable to the nature of the duty that we are engaged
in, whereby we express the sense we have of his essential or relative
glory, of which we have various instances in scripture,
wherein God’s people, in addressing themselves to him, have
made mention of his glorious names, titles, and attributes, in
variety of expressions. Thus David, in his Psalms, that contain
the matter and form of prayers, sometimes begins them
with the name of God, to whom they are directed; as when he
says, <i>God be merciful unto us, and bless us</i>, &amp;c. Psal. lxvii. 1.
And elsewhere, <i>O God! thou art my God</i>, Psal. lxiii. 1. And
sometimes he makes mention of his name <i>Jehovah</i>; which we
translate <i>Lord</i>: Thus he says, <i>O Lord, rebuke me not in thy
wrath</i>, &amp;c. Psal. xxxviii. 1. And elsewhere, <i>I will love thee,
O Lord, my strength</i>, Psal. xviii. 1. And, <i>O Lord, our Lord,
how excellent is thy name in all the earth</i>, Psal. viii. 1. And
Solomon begins his prayer at the consecration of the temple;
<i>Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heaven above, or
earth beneath; who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants
that walk before thee with all their heart</i>, 1 Kings viii.
23. And Ezra begins his prayer, <i>O my God! I am ashamed,
and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God!</i> Ezra ix. 6. And
Daniel expresses himself thus, in the preface to his prayer, <i>O
Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant, and
mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments</i>,
Dan. ix. 4. These are all expressions, that denote reverence,
and adoration; which, together with other instances
of the like nature, are of use for our direction, as to what respects
the preface, or beginning of our prayers to God; but
the preface to the Lord’s prayer is somewhat different; in
which we are taught,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. To address ourselves to God as a Father; which relation
includes in it,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Something common to mankind in general; in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>respect we are to adore him as our Creator, our Owner, and
Benefactor, <i>in whom we live, and move, and have our being</i>,
Acts xvii. 28. as the prophet says, <i>Have we not all one Father?
hath not one God created us?</i> Mal. ii. 10. And elsewhere it
is said, <i>He formeth the spirit of man within him</i>, Zech. xii. 1.
upon which account he is called, <i>the God of the spirits of all
flesh</i>, Numb. xvi. 22. and, <i>the Father of spirits</i>, Heb. xii. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) God being a Father to his people, sometimes denotes
that external covenant-relation which they stand in to him, as
a people called by his name, favoured with the means of grace,
and as such, the objects of that care and goodness, which he is
pleased to extend to those whom he governs by laws given by
special revelation from heaven, and encourages to wait on him
in those ordinances, in which they may hope for his presence,
and also promises all saving blessings to those that give up
themselves to him by faith. In this sense we are to understand
those scriptures, in which God says, <i>Israel is my son, even
my first-born</i>, Exod. iv. 22. And, <i>I have nourished and brought
up children, and they have rebelled against me</i>, Isa. i. 2. And,
<i>Wilt thou not, from this time cry to me, My Father, thou art
the guide of my youth</i>, Jer. iii. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) The relation which God stands in to his people, as a
Father, is sometimes taken in the highest sense, as implying
in it discriminating grace, or special love, which he is pleased
to extend to the heirs of salvation. Thus he is called so by
right of redemption; in which respect Christ is styled, <i>The
everlasting Father</i>, Isa. ix. 6. as being the Head and Redeemer
of his people. And the church says, <i>Thou, O Lord, art our
Father, our Redeemer; thy name is from everlasting</i>, chap. lxiii.
16. And believers are called his children by regeneration; in
which respect they are said to be <i>born of God</i>, John i. 13. and
to be <i>made partakers of a divine</i>, 2 Pet. i. 4. that is, an holy
and spiritual <i>nature</i>, which had its rise from God, when he was
pleased to instamp his image upon them, consisting in holiness
and righteousness. They are also called the children of God
by adoption; thus he is said to have <i>predestinated them to the
adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself</i>, Eph. i. 5. and
they are said to <i>receive the adoption of sons</i>, Gal. iv. 5. and as
such, have a right to the inheritance of children, Rom. viii. 17.
compared with Col. i. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>These various senses in which God is said to be a Father
to man, may serve for our direction when we style him, <i>Our
Father</i>, in prayer. Unregenerate persons, when they pray to
God, can ascend no higher than what is contained in their relation
to him as a God of nature, and of providence; who are
obliged to adore him for the blessings which they have received
from him, as the effects of common bounty, which include
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>in them all the blessings which belong to this life, together
with his patience, forbearance, and long-suffering, which delays
to inflict the punishment that sin deserves. Therefore,
when they say, <i>Our Father</i>, they acknowledge that they derive
their being from him, and though they cannot lay claim to the
benefits of Christ’s redemption, yet they confess their obligations
to God as their Creator; and consider him as having
given them souls capable of spiritual blessings, and themselves
as daily receiving the good things of this life from him, and
dependent on him for those things that tend to the comfort and
support of life. They also stand in need of those blessings
which are suited to the nature of the soul, and consequently
beg that they may not remain destitute of those things that
may conduce to their everlasting welfare; and therefore they
may use the Psalmist’s words, <i>Thy hands have made me, and
fashioned me: Give me understanding, that I may learn thy
commandments</i>, Psal. cxix. 73.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for those who are God’s children, by an external covenant-relation,
there is something more implied therein, than
barely their being creatures; for herein they are led to adore
him for those discoveries that he has made in the gospel, of the
way of salvation by Jesus Christ, who calls and invites sinners
to come to him, and encourages them to hope, that those who
are enabled to do so in a right manner, he will, in no wise,
cast out; therefore, when they call upon God as their Father
in prayer, it is, in effect, to say; Lord, we cannot conclude
ourselves to be thy children, as redeemed, effectually called
and sanctified; nor can we lay claim to the inheritance laid up
for thy saints in heaven; yet we are encouraged to wait on
thee in the ordinances of thine appointment, and to hope for
thy special presence therein, whereby they may be made effectual
for our salvation. We are, indeed, destitute of special
grace, and cannot conclude that we have a right to the saving
blessings of the covenant; yet, through thy great goodness, we
still enjoy the means of grace. We have not been admitted
to partake of Christ’s fulness, nor to eat of the bread of life;
yet we are thankful for those blessings of thy house, which
thou art pleased to continue to us; and since thou still includest
us in the number of those who are thy children as favoured
with the gospel, we humbly take leave, upon this account,
to call thee our Father, and to wait and hope for thy
salvation, and continue to implore that grace from thee, which
will give us a right to the best of blessings that we stand in
need of.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c012'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>As for those who are God’s children in the highest sense, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>redemption, regeneration, and adoption, they may draw nigh
to him, with an holy boldness; for these have, as the apostle
expresseth it, the <i>Spirit of adoption whereby they cry, Abba,
Father</i>; they have reason to adore him for privileges of the
highest nature, that he has conferred upon them, and to encourage
themselves that he will bestow upon them all the
blessings they stand in need of as to this, or a better world.
These may draw nigh to God with confidence of his fatherly
goodness, and their interest therein; which they ought to take
notice of and improve, in order to their drawing nigh to him,
in a right manner, in prayer, as well as to induce them to behave
themselves, in the whole course of their conversation, as those
who are taken into this honourable relation to him. Accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] This should raise their admiring thoughts of him, that
they, who were, by nature, strangers and enemies to him, should
be admitted to partake of this inestimable privilege; as the apostle
says, <i>Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed
upon us, that we should be called the sons of God!</i> 1 John iii. 1.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] We should also take encouragement from hence, to hope
that he will hear and answer our prayers, though very imperfect,
so far as it may tend to his glory and our real advantage.
Thus our Saviour says, <i>If ye then, being evil, know how to give
good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father,
which is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him?</i>
Matt. vii. 11. Do we pray for spiritual blessings, such as the
increase of grace, strength against corruption, and to be kept
from temptation, or falling by it? we have ground to conclude
that these shall be granted us, inasmuch as they are purchased
for us by Christ, promised in the covenant of grace, as we have
the earnest and first-fruits of the Spirit in our hearts, whereby
we are sealed unto the day of redemption. And when we pray
for temporal blessings, we have reason to hope they shall be
granted, if they be necessary for us, since our Saviour says,
<i>Our heavenly Father knoweth that we have need of all these
things</i>, Matt. vi. 32.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] This should excite in us those child-like dispositions,
which are agreeable to this relation, not only when we draw
nigh to God in prayer, but in the whole conduct of our lives.
And it includes in it,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, Humility and reverence, which is not only becoming
those who have an interest in his love, and a liberty of access
into his presence, with hope of acceptance in his sight; but it
is what we are obliged to, as his peculiar people, and a branch
of that honour which is due to him as our God and Father.
Thus he says, by the prophet, <i>A son honoureth his father</i>,
Mal. i. 6. whereby he intimates that this is the character and
disposition of those that stand in the relation of children to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>him. And the apostle argues from the less to the greater,
when he says, that <i>we have had fathers of our flesh, which corrected
us, and we gave them reverence, shall we not much rather
be in subjection to the Father of Spirits</i>, Heb. xii. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, Patience under rebukes, considering our proneness to
go astray, whereby we not only deserve them, but they are rendered
necessary; and especially when we consider that they
flow from love, and are designed for our good; as the apostle
says, <i>Whom the Lord loveth he chastneth, and scourgeth every
son whom he receiveth</i>, ver. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Another child-like disposition is being grieved for our
Father’s frowns; especially that we have incurred his displeasure
by our misbehaviour towards him; and it contains in it a
readiness to confess our faults, and a carefulness to avoid them
for the future.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, Contentment with the provision of our Father’s house,
whatever it be. We shall never, indeed, have the least cause
to complain of scarcity, as the returning prodigal in the parable
says, that even the <i>hired servants of his father, had bread enough,
and to spare</i>, Luke xv. 17. It can hardly be supposed
that he who is at the fountain head, can perish for thirst; nevertheless,
though we are not straitened in God, yet we are
often straitened in our bowels, through the weakness of our
faith, when we are not inclined to receive what God holds
forth to us in the gospel; and then we are discontented and
uneasy, while the blame lies at our own door; whereas, if we
behaved ourselves as the children of such a Father, we should
not only be pleased with, but constantly adore and live upon
that fulness of grace that there is in Christ; and whether he
is pleased to give us more or less of the blessings of common
providence, we should learn, <i>in whatsoever state we are, therewith
to be content</i>, Phil. iv. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>5thly</i>, Obedience to a father’s commands, without disputing
his authority, or right to govern us, is another child-like disposition.
Thus when we draw nigh to God as to our Father,
we are to express a readiness to do whatever he requires,
whereby we not only approve ourselves subjects under a law,
but, as the apostle styles it, <i>Obedient children</i>, as being <i>holy in
all manner of conversation</i>, 1 Pet. i. 14, 15.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>6thly</i>, Another disposition of children is, that they have a
fervent zeal for their father’s honour, and cannot bear to hear
him reproached without the highest resentment. Thus the
children of God, how much soever they may be concerned
about their own affairs, when injuriously treated by the world,
are always ready to testify their utmost dislike of every thing
that reflects dishonour on him, or his ways.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>7thly</i>, Another child-like disposition is love, which the relation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>of a father engages to. Thus when we draw nigh to God
as our Father, we express our love to him, which is founded
in his divine excellencies, which render him the object of the
highest delight and esteem.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>8thly</i>, He that has a child-like disposition, retains a grateful
sense of the obligations that he is under to his Father. Thus
we ought to be duly sensible of all the favours which we have
received from God, which are more than can be numbered;
the contrary hereunto, is reckoned the basest ingratitude and
disingenuity, altogether unbecoming the temper of children.
Thus Moses says to Israel, <i>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O
foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy Father who hath
bought thee? hath he not made, and established thee?</i>
Deut. xxxii. 6. A believer’s obligations to God are so very
great, that he cannot look back upon his former state, or consider
what he was, how vile and unworthy of any regard from
him, how miserable and unable to help himself, when he first
had compassion on him, without seeing himself under the
strongest engagements to be entirely, and for ever, his; which
is a becoming behaviour towards such a Father.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>9thly</i>, Love to all that are related to us as children of the
same Father, is another child-like disposition. In like manner
our love to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ, is a
temper becoming the children of God; and, indeed, it is no
other than a loving God in them, as we behold his image instamped
upon them; and hereby we express the high esteem
we have for regenerating grace, whereby God is denominated
our common Father; and we, being acted by the same principle,
are obliged and inclined to love as brethren. Thus they
who love God, are induced to love his children, as the apostle
says, <i>Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that
is begotten of him</i>, 1 John v. 1. and he also assigns this as an
evidence that <i>we are passed from death to life, because we love
the brethren</i>, chap. iii. 14. Thus concerning our drawing nigh
to God, as to a Father, as we are taught to do in this prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are directed, in this prayer, to draw nigh to God, as
being in heaven; which is the most glorious part of the frame
of nature, in which his power, wisdom, and goodness is eminently
displayed, as he designed it to be an eternal habitation
for the best of creatures, to whom he would discover more of
his glory than to any others; and in this respect it is called his
<i>throne</i>, Acts vii. 49. And this leads us,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) To have high and awful thoughts of the majesty and
greatness of God, whom all the hosts of heaven worship, with
the utmost reverence, and are satisfied with the immense treasure
of his goodness. We therefore take occasion from hence
to admire his infinite condescension, that he will look upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>creatures here below; thus Solomon, in his prayer says, <i>Will
God, indeed, dwell on the earth? behold the heaven, and the heaven
of heavens cannot contain thee</i>, 1 Kings viii. 27. will he
therefore look down upon those, who are so mean, deformed,
and destitute of his image, as we are, who dwell in houses of
clay, and deserve to be banished out of his sight?</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) It should also be improved by us to teach us humility
and modesty, in our conceptions and discourse, concerning
God, and divine things: It is but a little that we know of the
affairs of the upper world, and the way and manner in which
God is pleased to manifest himself to his saints and angels
there; and we know much less of his divine perfections, which
the inhabitants of heaven adore, being sensible of the infinite
distance they stand at from him, as creatures, upon which
account they cannot comprehend, or find out the Almighty to
perfection; and shall we pretend to search out the secrets of
his wisdom, or express ourselves in prayer, as though we were
speaking to one that was our equal, or could fathom the infinite
depths of his unsearchable counsels? Thus Solomon’s
advice may be well adapted to this case, <i>Be not rash with thy
mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before
God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth; therefore let
thy words be few</i>, 1 Kings viii. 27. We are not to think that
we may say what we please, or be rash and inconsiderate in
what we say, when we are <i>before the Lord; for he is in heaven</i>:
And when it is farther inferred, that <i>therefore our words should
be few</i>, that is, we should not think that the efficacy of our
prayers depends upon the multitude of our words; or if we
speak more or less to God, our expressions ought not to be
bold, rash, hasty, or inconsiderate, but with a becoming decency
and reverence, as those who are speaking to the majesty
of heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) It should put us upon meditating frequently on the
glory of the heavenly state, as those who hope at last, to be
joined with that happy and numerous assembly, who are, in
God’s immediate presence, in heaven: and therefore our conversation
should be there; and we should profess ourselves to
be sojourners here on earth, seeking a better country, looking
and waiting for the glorious appearing of the great God, our
Saviour; and hoping, that when he comes, he will receive us
to heaven, where our hearts are at present, as our treasure is
there.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We are, in this prayer, farther taught, that it is our duty
to pray with, and for others, as we say, <i>Our Father</i>: Hereby
we signify our relation to, and concern for, all the members of
Christ’s mystical body; therefore, if we do not join with others
in prayer, we are to have them upon our hearts, who are the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>objects of Christ’s special love and care. This argues, that
we have a sympathy with all those who are exposed to the
same wants and miseries with ourselves; and we take a great
deal of delight in considering them as subjects of the same
common Lord, joining in the same profession with ourselves;
concerning whom, we desire and hope that we shall be glorified
together.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, if we join with others in prayer, so that the
whole assembly make their supplications by one that is their
mouth, to God; this is what we call social worship: Therefore
it is our duty to pray with, as well as for others; and in
this case we must take heed that nothing be contained in
united prayer, but what the whole assembly may join in, as
being expressive of their faith, desires, or experiences; otherwise
there cannot be that beautiful harmony therein, such as
the nature and design of the duty we are jointly engaged in,
calls for: and this is agreeable to social or united prayers, in
which all the petitions are to be adapted to the particular case
of every one who addresses himself to God, how numerous
soever the worshipping assembly may be; and therefore we
are obliged to make use of that mode of expression, in which
we are taught to say, <i>Our Father</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus our Saviour directs us how we should begin our
prayers to God; and, inasmuch as this ought to be reduced
to practice, I shall give a summary account of what is contained
in this preface; that we may be furnished with matter
taken from thence, in order to our addressing ourselves to God
in prayer, in a way agreeable thereunto, when we come into
his presence with such a frame of spirit as the importance of
the duty requires; accordingly we are to express ourselves to
this purpose, “O our God, we desire to draw nigh to thee with
a becoming reverence, and an awful sense of thine infinite
perfections: When we consider thee as a jealous God, and
ourselves as sinful, guilty creatures, we might well be afraid
to come before thee; but thou hast encouraged us to approach
thy presence as to a Father, in, and through the
merits and mediation of our Lord Jesus Christ; and therefore
we come with an humble boldness before thy throne of
grace, confessing that though we are called thy children, we
have been very undutiful and rebellious against thee, and
therefore unworthy of that relation or of the inheritance
which thou hast laid up for those whom thou hast ordained
to eternal life. Thou, O Lord, hast established thy throne
in the heavens, where there is an innumerable company of
angels and spirits of just men made perfect, who all behold
thy face, and are made completely blessed in thine immediate
presence: As for us, we dwell in houses of clay; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>we earnestly beg that we may be made meet for, and then
admitted into that happy society, that we may worship thee
in a more perfect manner than we are capable of doing in
this imperfect state. May all the powers and faculties of
our souls be renewed, and influenced by thy holy Spirit, that
we may have our conversation in heaven, whilst we are here
below, and in all things, may be enabled to approve ourselves
thy children, have a constant sense of duty, and the manifold
obligations thou hast laid us under, that we may love, delight
in, and submit to thee in all things, and have a fervent
zeal for the honour of thy name as becomes thy children,
that we, together with all thy faithful servants, may be under
thy safe protection here, and be received to thy glory hereafter.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CXC.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXC.</span> <i>What do we pray for the first petition?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> In the first petition [which is, <i>Hallowed be thy Name</i>,]
acknowledging the utter inability and indisposition that is
in ourselves and all men to honour God aright, we pray that
God would, by his grace, enable and incline us, and others,
to know, to acknowledge, and highly to esteem him, his
titles, attributes, ordinances, word, works, and whatsoever
he is pleased to make himself known by, and to glorify him
in thought, word, and deed; that he would prevent and remove
atheism, ignorance, idolatry, profaneness, and whatsoever
is dishonourable to him; and, by his over-ruling providence,
direct and dispose of all things to his own glory.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having considered the preface to the Lord’s prayer, the
next part of which it consists, is petitions; and these are
six, which are laid down in this method.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. We are taught to pray for what concerns God’s glory,
which is the highest and most valuable end; and therefore
ought first to be prayed for: And this is the subject-matter of
the three first petitions.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are directed to pray for what respects our own advantage,
which is contained in the three last petitions, in which
we are directed to pray for outward blessings, as in the fourth
petition, and then for spiritual, without which outward blessings
would afford us no relish or savour, nor render us truly
happy. These spiritual blessings include in them either forgiveness
of sin, and this we pray for in the fifth petition; or
our being sanctified and delivered from the prevalency of corruption
and temptation, together with all the evils that sin exposes
us to; this we pray for in the sixth petition. That which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>we are more particularly to consider in this answer, is, what
we are taught to pray for in the first petition, which is contained
in these words, <i>Hallowed be thy name</i>. By the <i>name</i>
of God we are to understand every thing, by which he is
pleased to make himself known to his creatures, as when he
discovers himself in his divine perfections, which are either essential
or personal, absolute or relative; and in his glorious
titles, as the Lord of Hosts, the God and Rock of Israel, the
hope of Israel, the God that cannot lye, the Father of mercies,
the God of all grace and glory, the preserver of man; which
have all a tendency to raise in us the highest veneration for,
and esteem of him. He has also made himself known by his
ordinances, words, and works: These are the subject-matter of
this petition; and when we pray that they may be sanctified,
we are not to understand hereby that they may be made holy;
but that the holiness and glory thereof may be demonstrated
by him, and that we may be enabled to adore and magnify him
agreeably thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the name of God may be said to be sanctified either
by himself or by his people in different respects; accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. We pray that God would sanctify, that is, demonstrate
the glory of his own name, or proclaim and make it visible to
the world, so as to excite that adoration and esteem which is
due to him. His name, indeed, has been eminently glorified
in all ages, in the various methods of his providence and
grace; whereby his power, wisdom, and goodness have been
illustrated in the eyes of angels and men; and, in all his
works, he has appeared to be a God of infinite holiness: We
therefore pray that he would continue to glorify these perfections,
and enable us to improve the displays thereof to our
spiritual advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a subject of the highest importance, without which
we cannot give to God the glory due unto his name; therefore,
as praise is joined with prayer, it is necessary for us to
take a view of the various ways by which God has manifested
the glory of his holiness. We might here consider how he
did this in his creating man at first, without the least blemish
or disposition in his nature to sin, and enstamped his own
image upon him, which principally consisted in holiness,
which was the greatest internal beauty and ornament that he
could be endowed with.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that which we shall principally consider, is, how the
holiness of God is demonstrated in his dealings with fallen
man. His suffering sin to enter into the world, was not inconsistent
with the holiness of his nature, since his providence, as
has been observed elsewhere, was not conversant about it, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>bringing any under a natural necessity of sinning; and therefore
there is not the least ground to charge him, with being
the author of sin. We now proceed to shew how the holiness
of God was glorified in the dispensations of his providence towards
fallen man, and in the methods he took in order to his
recovery.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The holiness of God was glorified, or he sanctified his
great name, in the dispensations of his providence towards
fallen man, before he gave him any hope of salvation. It cannot
be supposed that this rebellion against, and apostacy from
God, should not be highly resented by him; accordingly we
read of his proceeding against the rebel as a judge, charging
his crime upon him, and passing sentence pursuant to the demerit
of his sin; and all the miseries that we are exposed to,
either in this life, or that which is to come, are the result of
the display of his holiness, as a sin-revenging Judge. As soon
as ever our first parents sinned against him, he charged the
guilt thereof on their consciences, and thereby filled them with
a dread of his wrath: Hence proceeded an inclination to flee
from his presence; and when they heard the voice of the
Lord coming to call them to an account for what they had
done, they were afraid.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is God’s usual method in dealing with sinful creatures:
He first convinces them of sin by the law, and awakens
the conscience, so that his terrors are set in array against it
round about, before he speaks good and comfortable words by
the gospel: And by this means he sanctifies his name, and
thereby discovers his infinite hatred of all sin: but we shall
principally consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. How God glorifies his holiness in the method he has
taken to deliver man from that guilt and misery, under which
he had brought himself. The terms of reconciliation and salvation,
were such as tended to secure the glory of his justice;
and therefore he insisted on a satisfaction to be given, without
making the least abatement of any part of the debt of punishment
that was due for our sin; and accordingly <i>he spared not
his own Son</i>, Rom. viii. 32. but delivered him over unto death,
and obliged him to drink the bitterest part of that cup which
was most formidable to nature, and which, had it been possible,
he would fain have been excused from drinking; therefore
he is represented, by one of the evangelists, as praying,
that God the Father would <i>take this cup from him</i>, Mark xiv.
35, 36. and by another, that he would <i>save him from this hour</i>,
John xii. 27. Nevertheless, he expresses the utmost resignation
to the divine will; and being sensible that this was an expedient
to glorify the holiness of God, he does, as it were, give a check
to the voice of nature, and submits to bear the punishment he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>came into the world to suffer, how terrible soever it might be;
and therefore says, <i>Father glorify thy name</i>, q. d. ver. 28. take
what method is most expedient to demonstrate the glory of
thy holiness let the whole debt be exacted on me, I am willing
to pay the utmost farthing: Upon this God says, by a voice
from heaven, <i>I have glorified it, and will glorify it again</i>;
that is, in every step that has been, or shall be taken, in order
to the bringing about the work of redemption, I have hallowed
my name, and will do it hereafter. And, in this respect, God’s
holiness was glorified in finishing transgression, making an end
of sin, bringing in everlasting righteousness, and also in the
impetration of redemption, by our great Mediator and Surety.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. God has sanctified his name in all the methods which he
has taken in the application of redemption, in the various dispensations
of his providence and grace towards his church and
people; and in order hereunto, he has determined, that <i>if</i> his
<i>children forsake</i> his <i>law, and walk not in</i> his <i>judgements; if
they break</i> his <i>statutes and keep not</i> his <i>commandments, he will
visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with
stripes</i>, Psal. lxxxix. 30, 32. And this is done to manifest the
glory of his holiness: Though he is pleased to pardon their
iniquity for the sake of Christ’s righteousness; yet they shall
know, by experience, that he hates it; and therefore, whatever
be his designs of grace, with respect to his redeemed ones, as
to the event thereof, they shall, notwithstanding, find that their
sin shall not altogether go unpunished, though this punishment
be not of the same kind with that which was suffered by
Christ, from the hand of vindictive justice demanding satisfaction.
Moreover, God has sanctified his name, in that he
has connected sanctification with salvation; therefore he has
said, <i>Without holiness no man shall see the Lord</i>, Heb. xii. 14.
He first makes his people holy, and then happy; every mercy
that he bestows, is a motive or inducement to holiness; and all
the ordinances and means of grace are made subservient to
answer this end.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we may take occasion to observe the various methods,
whereby God has sanctified his name, in all his dealings with
his church, in the various ages thereof, both before and since
our Saviour’s incarnation;</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Under the legal dispensation. The people, whom he
chose out of all the nations of the earth, and called them by
his name; among whom he designed to magnify his perfections
in such a way, as argued them to be the peculiar objects
of his regard above all others, as he designed to make them
high in name, in praise, and in honour; these are styled <i>an
holy people</i>, Deut. xxvi. 19. and elsewhere, <i>holiness unto the
Lord</i>, Jer. ii. 3. and the wonderful things that he did for them in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>destroying their enemies, when he brought them out of Egyptian
bondage, gave them occasion to celebrate his name, as a God
<i>glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders</i>, Exod. xv.
11. and the worship that he established among them was such,
in which he expressly required holiness, both in heart and life;
and when, at any time, they cast a reproach on his perfections,
or defiled and debased his holy institutions, he testified his displeasure
against them in the highest degree: Of this we have
various instances in the judgments which he has executed on
particular persons for not performing what he had commanded,
with the greatest exactness, in those things which related to
his worship: Thus when Nadab and Abihu <i>offered strange
fire</i>, they were <i>devoured, before the Lord, by fire from heaven</i>,
Lev. x. 1, 2. And, when David was bringing the ark of God
to Jerusalem, we read, that Uzzah put forth his hand to take
hold of it to prevent its falling, when shaken by the oxen,
which he, doubtless, did with a good design, and it is therefore
called an <i>error</i>, rather than a presumptuous sin; yet it is said,
that <i>the anger of the Lord was kindled against him, so that he
smote him that he died</i> by it, 2 Sam. vi. 6, 7. this being contrary
to an express law which God had given, that the sons of
Kohath should <i>bear the ark, but they should not touch it, or any
holy thing</i> that was covered, <i>lest they die</i>, Numb. iv. 15. And
elsewhere we read, that some of the men of Bethshemesh, because
they had <i>looked into the ark of the Lord, were smitten, so
that fifty thousand, and threescore and ten of them died</i>, 1 Sam.
vi. 19. inasmuch as God had forbidden that any should indulge
their curiosity, so far as to look on the holy things on
pain of death, Numb. iv. 20. And he also threatened the
children of Israel with death, if any of them who were not appointed
to minister in holy things, came nigh the tabernacle of
the congregation, so as to perform that service which they
were not sanctified or called to, since this was reckoned no
other than an instance of profaneness in them. And if Aaron
himself, whose office was to go into the holiest of all to perform
the yearly service, in which he was to make atonement
for the sins of the whole congregation, presumed to do this, at
any other time but that day which God had appointed, he was
to be punished with death, Lev. xvi. 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, when any thing was brought into the worship of God,
contrary to what he had instituted, which was reckoned no
other than a profaning it, God hallowed his own name, by
pouring forth his wrath on those who gave occasion to, or complied
with it. Thus when Jeroboam, set up calves in Bethel
and Dan, <i>made priests of the lowest of the people, which were
not of the sons of Levi, ordained feasts</i> like those which God had
appointed; and, in many other instances, corrupted his worship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>whereby the people, who complied with him herein,
were led aside from God, it is said, <i>This became sin unto the
house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off
the face of the earth</i>, 1 Kings xii. 29-33. compared with chap.
xiii. 34. And when Ahaz <i>erected an altar, according to the
pattern of that which he saw at Damascus, and sacrificed to the
gods of the people</i>, from whom he had took the pattern thereof, this
brought <i>ruin</i> on him and his kingdom, 2 Kings xvi. 10. compared
with 2 Chron. xxviii. 23. And when Uzziah usurped
the priest’s office, by offering incense in the temple, God immediately
testified his displeasure against him, by <i>smiting him
with leprosy</i>; whereby he was separated from the congregation
of the Lord, and rendered unfit to govern his people to
the day of his death, 2 Chron. xxvi. 16, 20, 21. And when
holy men, in any instance, have not sanctified his name in the
eyes of the people, God has highly resented it: Thus when
Moses and Aaron <i>spake unadvisedly with their lips</i>, upon
which account they are said <i>not to sanctify the name of God at
the waters of Meribah</i> he tells them, that therefore they should
not <i>bring the children of Israel into the land of Canaan, but
should die in the wilderness</i>, Numb. xx. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, as we have many instances of the judgments of God on
particular persons, for not sanctifying his name; so we have a
public and visible display of his holiness, in his dealings with
the whole nation of Israel, after their many revolts from him,
when they served other gods, and not only corrupted, but laid
aside his institutions, and were guilty of those vile abominations,
which were inconsistent with the least pretensions to holiness;
God sanctified his own name, not only by reproving
them by the prophets, but sending those many judgments
which were the forerunners of that desolation, which they had
reason to expect, and then by delivering them into the hand of
those who carried them captive, Israel into Assyria, and Judah
into Babylon. This leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) How God has, and still continues to sanctify his name,
under the gospel-dispensation. Our Lord Jesus Christ, who
is the Head and Saviour of his church, has, in his whole administration,
set forth the glory of God’s holiness. This appears,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] In that he came into the world, with a commission from
his Father, to engage in the work of our redemption; and accordingly
he is said to have been <i>sanctified and sent into</i> it for
this very purpose, John x. 36. And, when he entered on his
public ministry, he produced his commission, and gave undeniable
proofs that he was the Messiah, the person whom God
the Father had <i>sealed</i>, and set over his house to manage this
great affair. Every miracle which he wrought, was a divine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>testimony for the confirmation of this truth, that the gospel-dispensation
took its rise from Christ our great Mediator,
and was a glorious display of the holiness of God; and the
world could not have the least ground to think they were imposed
on, when they concluded that this Jesus was he that was
to come into the world (according to the predictions of all the
holy prophets that went before him) to erect that dispensation
in which his own and his Father’s glory were eminently
to shine forth, and thereby the name of God was to be hallowed
in a greater degree than it had ever been before.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] God sanctifies his own name under the gospel-dispensation,
in raising Christ from the dead, after he had finished the
work which he came into the world about; in which respect it
may be said of him, that <i>for</i>, or after <i>the suffering of death, he
was crowned with glory and honour</i>, Heb. ii. 9. and put into a
capacity of applying the redemption which he had purchased,
so that God the Father <i>glorified the Son, that the Son also might
glorify him</i>, John xvii. 1. That this was not done till he had
made a full satisfaction to the justice of God, and thereby glorified
his holiness to the utmost, has been already considered;
after this he entered upon his glory; and from that time the
gospel-dispensation might, by way of eminency, be said to begin,
upon which occasion we may apply the words of the
Psalmist, ‘Sing unto the Lord ye saints of his, and give
thanks at the remembrance of his holiness,’ Psal. xxx. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] God sanctified or hallowed his name in the method
which he took in his dealings with the Jewish nation, after
Christ’s ascension into heaven, which made way for the establishment
of the gospel-church, and was in itself an awful display
of his holiness. It must be supposed, that the treatment,
which our Saviour met with from that nation, who might be
said herein to fill up the measure of their iniquities to the utmost,
would be followed with some terrible displays of divine
vengeance; and thus it was, as appeared by the utter ruin of
their civil and religious liberties, which were the immediate
consequence thereof; and this is a visible proof of the truth of
the Christian religion, and a very awful instance of God’s being
sanctified in them.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] The holiness of God farther appears in the methods
which he took to propagate his gospel through the world,
which was not to be done by might or power, nor by those
methods of secular policy, whereby civil states are advanced;
but by his Spirit, whereby they who were called, were sufficiently
qualified for this important work; who preached the
gospel to all nations, according to the commission that was
given them, confirmed it by miracles, and were instrumental
in gathering a people out of the world, that yielded themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>willing subjects to Christ, a people called by his name, and
subjected and entirely devoted to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] The holiness of God appears in all those doctrines which
were preached, on which the faith of the church is built, and
those ordinances in which they were to express their subjection
to Christ, and hope of salvation by him.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, The doctrines of the gospel are all pure and holy; their
great design is to set forth the harmony of the divine perfections,
as displayed in the method of salvation by Jesus Christ;
and to induce those who are made partakers thereof, to serve
him in holiness and righteousness; and there is no gospel-doctrine
that gives the least countenance, or leads to licentiousness.
None have a right to claim an interest in Christ’s
righteousness, or to hope for that salvation which he has
purchased, but they who believe, and none can be said to believe,
to the saving of the soul, but they who are enabled to
perform all those duties, whereby it will appear, that they are
an holy, as well as an happy people.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, All those ordinances which Christ has instituted in the
gospel, have a tendency to set forth the holiness of God. What
these are, has been considered under foregoing answers; as
also, that they were instituted by Christ, and that no creature
has a right to invent any modes of worship, or make any additions
to his institutions, without incurring the guilt of depraving
and sullying the beauty of gospel-worship<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c012'><sup>[114]</sup></a>; and therefore
all that I shall add under this head, is, that as these are
set apart, and sanctified by God, to be means of grace, and
pledges of his presence; so they, who engage herein, are to do
it with this view, that they may be made holy in all conversation,
as he who hath called them is holy; and hereby God
sanctifies his own name in the dispensations of his providence
and grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now when we pray, <i>Hallowed be thy name</i>, with a particular
view to what God does in order hereunto, we adore him
with an holy trembling, when we behold the displays of his vindictive
justice in punishing sin; and if he sees it necessary to
secure his own honour as the governor of the world, so that
without it he would not appear to be an holy God, nor the
glory of his truth in those threatenings which he has denounced
against sin, discovered, we are fully satisfied that all his
ways are right, as acquiescing in his providence; and when
his judgments are made manifest, we say, <i>Hallowed be thy
name</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, when we put up this petition, with a particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>view to God’s executing his threatened vengeance on his enemies,
several cautions are to be used. As,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, We are to take heed that we do not do this out of hatred
to the persons of any, for even they who are the monuments
of divine justice, in whom God will be glorified as a sin-revenging
judge, are the objects of our compassion, as they
are miserable, how much soever that sin, which is the cause
thereof, is to be hated and detested by us.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, We must always pray, that God would rather convert
than destroy his enemies, were it consistent with his purpose,
which must be accomplished.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, We are never called to pray expressly for the damnation
of any one, how great an enemy soever he may have been
to God or us; but rather, on the other hand, that God would
glorify his name in his salvation by Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, If we pray that God would prevent those evils, which
his church is exposed to, through the power or malice of its
enemies, and, in order thereunto, that he would remove them
out of the way, that they may not be able to hurt them; this
is to be considered only as an expedient for their safety, so
that if one of the two must suffer ruin, we rather desire that it
may be his enemies than his people. We should be glad if
God would be pleased to bring about the welfare of his church
some other way; but if not, when we pray that his name herein
may be hallowed, it is principally with submission to his
will, and an humble acknowledgment that all his judgments
are right. Thus concerning God’s sanctifying his own name,
as the subject-matter of our prayer in this petition.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. When we pray, <i>Hallowed be thy name</i>, we signify our desire
that we may be enabled to glorify God in every thing
whereby he makes himself known: In which there is something
supposed, namely, that all men are utterly unable and
disinclined, of themselves, to honour God aright, or to improve
the various displays of his glory, which we behold in
his word and works: This arises from the sinfulness of our nature,
our alienation from, and opposition to an holy God; so
that without the assistance of his Spirit, we are not able to do
any thing that is good; and therefore we pray that God would
make us holy, by rendering the means of grace conducive
thereunto, that we may give him the glory due to his name.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the thing more especially prayed for, with respect to
ourselves and others is, that we may be enabled to act suitably
to the discoveries which God has made of his divine perfections;
that we may adore his wisdom, power, and goodness
in all he does, and worship him in all ordinances in an holy
manner, or, as the Psalmist expresses it, <i>Worship the Lord
in the beauty of holiness</i>, Psal. xxix. 2. We are also to desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>that all his holy institutions may be made means of grace to
us, that we may be sanctified by his truth, that beholding, as
in a glass, the glory of the Lord, we may be transformed into
his image, consisting of holiness and righteousness, that we
may have an high esteem of every thing whereby he makes
himself known, and glorify him in thought, word, and deed.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That we may never think or speak of the divine perfections,
but with a becoming reverence, and suitable acts of faith,
agreeably thereunto; that when he discovers himself as a God
of infinite wisdom, we may not only admire the traces and
footsteps thereof, as they are visible in all his works, but desire
that we may thereby be made wise unto salvation. When we
conceive of him as a God of infinite power, we are to desire
that he would enable us to have recourse to him, to work all
that grace in us which can be effected by none but him with
whom all things are possible. And, when he discovers himself
as a God of infinite goodness and mercy, that we may be
encouraged to hope that we shall be made partakers thereof,
by his communicating to us the blessings that accompany salvation.
And when he reveals himself as a God of infinite holiness,
that we may be conformed to him, in some measure, so
as to be enabled to hate and fly from every thing which is contrary
thereunto; and that all sin, which contains in it a reflection
on the purity of his nature, as well as a contempt of his
authority, may be abhorred and detested by us. And when he
discovers himself as a God of infinite faithfulness, a God that
keepeth covenant and mercy, to them that fear him, who has
made many promises respecting their salvation, and will certainly
accomplish them, that we may depend upon, and put
our trust in him; that he would remember his good word unto
us, upon which he hath caused us to hope. When he makes
himself known as our Creator, he the Potter, and we the clay,
that we may be well pleased with all the dispensations of his
providence towards us, as considering that he has a right to
do what he will with his own. And when he reveals himself
as our Redeemer, we are to pray, that we may be able to conclude,
that we are bought with that invaluable price, which
Christ gave for his elect: And if we have a comfortable hope
concerning our interest therein, that we may walk as becomes
those who are hereby laid under the highest obligations to love
him, and live to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. That we may worship him in a right manner, in all his
ordinances: Accordingly, when he encourages us to attend to
what he imparts therein, as in hearing, or reading the word,
we pray, that we may be enabled to receive the truth in the
love thereof, and improve it as that which is not <i>the word of
men, but of God, which effectually worketh in them that believe</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>1 Thess. ii. 13. that we may esteem it as the only infallible
rule of faith and duty; that we may be enabled to <i>hide it in
our hearts, that we may not sin against him</i>, Psal. cxix. 11.
And when we should draw nigh to him in prayer, in which he
requires, that we should sanctify his name as a God all-sufficient,
on whom we depend for the supply of our wants; or
when we bless and praise him for what we have received, that
the frame of our spirits may be suited to the spirituality and
importance of the duty we are engaged in, that we may not be
like those whom our Saviour speaks of, who <i>draw nigh to him
with their mouths, and honour him with their lips, while their
heart is far from him</i>, Matt. xv. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. As God makes himself known to us by his works, we are
to beg of him, that in the work of creation, we may see and admire
his eternal power and Godhead, and in his works of common
providence, as upholding and governing all things, we
may take occasion to adore the manifold wisdom of God, his
almighty power, and the inexhaustible treasure of his goodness
which appears therein: But more especially when he discovers
himself in the gracious dispensations of his providence, in those
things which have an immediate reference to our salvation, we
are to beg of him, not only that he would enable us to look on
them with admiration; but, particularly, to express our love
and thankfulness to Christ our great Mediator and Advocate, as
those who humbly trust and hope that we have an interest in
him by faith. Thus concerning our requesting these things
for ourselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might here observe something concerning our doing it
for others, for whom we are to pray, that they may have the
highest esteem for God in all those respects and consequently
that his name may be known throughout the whole world, not
barely as the God of nature, but as he has revealed himself in
his word; and therefore we are to pray, that the way of salvation,
by Christ, may be known, and his name adored and magnified
as a Redeemer and Saviour in those parts of the world,
which are, at present, destitute of gospel-light; and that,
where the word is preached, it may be received with faith and
love, that they who are called Christians may walk more becoming
that relation which they stand in to the blessed Jesus.
Thus concerning the subject-matter of our requests in this petition,
respecting God’s enabling us and others, to glorify him in
every thing by which he makes himself known.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are two things inferred from hence in the close of this
answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That when we pray, that God would sanctify his name,
it is, in effect, to desire that he would prevent and remove every
thing which is dishonourable to it. Some things tend to cast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>so great a reproach on the name of God, that sinners are hereby
hardened in their opposition to him; as David, by his sin, is
said to have <i>given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to
blaspheme</i>, 2 Sam. xii. 14. And God is highly dishonoured by
those open and scandalous sins which are committed by such
as make a profession of religion; whereby it appears that they
are strangers to the power thereof, and lay a stumbling-block
in the way of those who are too ready to take an estimate of the
ways of God, from the conversation of them, who in words
profess, but in works deny him. Some deny the very being,
perfections and providence of God, or being ignorant of him,
worship they know not what; and there are others who treat
things sacred with profaneness and scurrility; and, instead of
sanctifying the name of God, openly blaspheme and cast a contempt
on all his sacred institutions. Therefore,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] We are to pray, that God would prevent and remove
atheism. When persons not only act as though there were no
God, but, with blasphemy, and daring insolence, express this
in words: These are generally hardened in their iniquities,
and bid defiance to his justice; as though they were, as it
is said of the Leviathan, <i>made without fear</i>, Job xii. 33. and
were not apprehensive of any ill consequences that will ensue
hereupon. These are not to be convinced by arguments,
though there is nothing that occurs in the works of creation
and providence, but what might confute and put them to silence,
did they duly attend to it: Therefore we are to pray,
that God would assert his divine being and perfections, and
give them some convincing proof thereof, by impressing the
dread and terror of his wrath upon their consciences, that hereby
they may learn not to blaspheme; or that he would give
them that internal light, by which they may be brought to
adore and sanctify his name. And whereas there are multitudes
of practical atheists, who behave themselves as though
there were no God to observe what they do, or punish them
for it, therefore they presumptuously conclude, that they may
rebel without being called to an account; we are to pray, that
God, by his grace, would prevent and fence against prevailing
impiety, by working a thorough reformation in the hearts of
men, to the end that practical godliness may be promoted, and
thereby he may be glorified.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] We are to pray, that God would prevent and remove
that ignorance which is inconsistent with persons sanctifying
his name. This respects, more especially the not knowing or
enquiring into those great doctrines, which are of the highest
importance, and more directly tend to the advancing the glory
of God, and the obtaining eternal life. In these who are destitute
of divine revelation, this ignorance is invincible; therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>with respect to such, we are to pray, that God would
grant to them the means of grace, by sending his gospel among
them; that they who sit in darkness, and in the region and shadow
of death, may have a glorious light shining about them,
whereby they may be made acquainted with the way of salvation
by Jesus Christ: But there are others who sit under the
sound of the gospel, and yet remain strangers to the great doctrines
thereof, who have no love to the truth, and act as though
it did not belong to them, to study the scriptures; these are
wilfully ignorant, like those who are said to <i>hate knowledge,
and not to choose the fear of the Lord</i>, Prov. i. 29. We are to
pray, with regard to such, that in order to their sanctifying the
name of God, they may be led into the knowledge of those
great doctrines, in which the glory of the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, is set forth, as it is in the work of redemption by
Christ, together with the way in which righteousness and life
may be attained; and that they may know what are those graces
which are inseparably connected with, and necessary to salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] We are to pray, that God would prevent or remove
idolatry; and that either such as is more gross and practised
by the Heathen and others, who give that worship to creatures,
that is due to God alone; or else, that idolatry which may be
observed in the hearts and lives of many, who though they
abhor the grosser acts thereof, are, nevertheless, guilty of this
sin, in that they love the creature more than God. This is
what we all are either chargeable with, or in danger of, which
is directly contrary to our sanctifying the name of God:
Therefore we are to pray, with respect to the former, that he
would convince them what they falsely call worship, is a dishonour
to, and abhorred by him; and, with respect to the
latter, that he deserves our supreme love, and will not admit
of any thing to stand in competition with him; and that he
would enable us to love him with all our heart, soul, mind,
and strength: And, in order hereunto, that he would deliver
us from the iniquity of covetousness, or those inordinate affections,
whereby we are inclined immoderately to pursue
after the world, which is inconsistent with an heavenly conversation;
and that we may be kept from self-seeking, or trusting
to our own righteousness for justification, or giving that
glory to any other which is due to God alone.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] We are also to pray for the preventing and removal of
that profaneness which is contrary to the sanctifying the name
of God; that persons may not give themselves that liberty,
which many do, to treat things sacred in a common way, or
make religion the subject of wit and drollery; which is very
disgustful to the ears of those who have an awe of God on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>their spirits, and altogether unbecoming persons professing
godliness. We are also to beg, that God would deliver us
from engaging in religious duties in a formal way, as though
his name were to be sanctified only by an external shew or
appearance of religion, without that internal frame or disposition
of heart which is required in all those who draw nigh
to him in an holy manner; and also that we may be kept from
making any innovation in the worship of God, and thereby
profane it, while we pretend to add to the beauty thereof, and
its acceptableness in his sight; which is so far from hallowing
his name, that it is highly provoking to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Another thing inferred from the account we have had
of those methods by which the name of God is said to be
sanctified, is, that we are to beg of him, that, by his overruling
providence, he would direct and dispose of all things
to his own glory. This is his immediate work; without which
his name would not be sanctified by his creatures. And it
consists in his bringing a revenue of glory to himself, out of
those things that seem to be subversive of it. It is one of the
glories of providence, that hereby God brings good out of
evil, and renders some things subservient to his interest, which,
in themselves, have a tendency to overthrow it.</p>

<p class='c006'>This may be observed in several things consequent upon the
sins and persecutions of the church. Thus when Israel revolted
from God, by making the golden calf in the wilderness,
he first humbled them greatly for it, and then spirited them
with zeal to execute judgment on those who did not repent of
it; and afterwards, when, at Moses’s intreaty, he forgave this
sin, he filled them with a zeal for the establishing his worship
equal to that which had been expressed before in profaning
his name; so that, as they then parted with their golden ear-rings,
to make the idol which they worshipped, Exod. xxxii.
2, 3. now they make a very large contribution for the building
of the tabernacle, chap. xxxv. 21-29. and xxxvi. 5, 6. And
when, by their abominable idolatry, they had provoked God
to give them into the hands of those that carried them captive
into Babylon: This was so far over-ruled by his providence,
as that they were never guilty of idolatry afterwards,
whatever temptations they had to it therein; so that when
they were returned from captivity, how much soever they
were chargeable with want of zeal for the building the temple,
and setting up public worship in it, Hag. i. 9. or, for many
other crimes, in that the priests sought their secular interest
rather than the glory of God, in performing several branches
of their office in a profane manner, and thereby rendering the
public worship contemptible, and offering the <i>refuse of the
flock</i> in sacrifice to God, for which they were reproved by him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>Mal. i. 10. <i>&amp; seq.</i> yet we never find them reproved for idolatry
after their captivity. This some think to be the meaning
of that vision which the prophet Zechariah had of the woman
who was called <i>wickedness, sitting the midst of Ephah</i>; and
this being <i>born</i> by <i>two women</i> that <i>had wings like the wings of
a stork</i> into <i>the land of Shinar</i>, viz. Chaldea, to build an house
for it, Zech. v. 7,-11. so that it might there be <i>established,
and set upon her own base</i>, intimating that the idolatry of the
Heathen should not spread itself among the Israelites as it had
done, but be confined to those parts of the world which had
set it up before; and therefore this is considered as what was
the proper seat thereof, and not the church. And this seems
also to be foretold by the prophet Hosea, when he says, that
<i>the children of Israel</i>, after they had <i>been many days without a
king, without a priest, and without a sacrifice</i>; adds, that <i>they
should be without an image</i>, Hos. iii. 4. The former was an
affliction, and denotes, that they should have their civil and religious
state broken and discontinued; the latter seems to intimate,
that providence would so far over-rule this, that they
should be disinclined and averse to idolatry, as they are at this
day, though, in other respects, altogether alienated from God.</p>

<p class='c006'>And all the persecutions which the church has met with
from its enemies, with a design to bring about its ruin and destruction,
have been over-ruled for the furtherance of the gospel.
Thus when Saul, before his conversion, <i>made havock of
the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women,
committed them to prison</i>; so that <i>a great persecution</i> was
raised against it by his instigation; and the people of God
could not meet safely at Jerusalem, but were <i>scattered abroad
throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria</i>, Acts viii. 1,-5.
this was ordered, by the providence of God, for the greater
spread of the gospel, so that the Samaritans received the word
of God. And in following ages, we may observe, that whatever
attempts have been made against the interest of Christ in
the world, they have, contrary to the design of his enemies,
been made subservient to the promoting its greater advancement,
as some have observed, that the blood of the martyrs
has been the seed of the church; and herein the Psalmist’s prediction
has been fulfilled, <i>Surely the wrath of man shall praise
thee</i>, and <i>the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain</i>, Psal.
lxxvi. 10. and oftentimes, when the gospel has, like the sea, lost
ground in one part of the world, it has gained it in another.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we may observe, that God glorifies his holiness
by over-ruling the falls and miscarriages of particular believers,
as hereby they are made more humble, watchful, and circumspect
for the future; and, when restored from their backslidings,
put upon admiring his grace, and excited to thankfulness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>which the nature of the thing requires. They also take occasion
from hence, to warn others, lest they be entangled in the
same snare, out of which they have escaped; or, if fallen, to
recommend to them those methods of divine grace where they
have been recovered. This improvement the Psalmist made
of the dealings of God with him, when he speaks of his being
<i>brought out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay; his feet set
upon a rock, and his goings established</i>; he adds, <i>many shall
see it and fear, and shall trust in the Lord</i>, Psal. xl. 2, 3. And
when God’s people have been greatly dejected under the troubles
they have met with; he has over-ruled this for the restoring
comforts to them, and then enabling them to comfort others,
in like afflictions, which, as the apostle expresses it, <i>redounds
to their consolation and salvation</i>, 2 Cor. i. 6. Thus concerning
the first petition of the Lord’s prayer, as it is explained in the
answer before us.</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall now consider how it may be reduced into practice,
that we may be directed in our addressing ourselves to God
in those things that concern the glory of his name. Accordingly,
it is as though we should say, “We adore thee, O our
God, that thou hast been pleased to make such discoveries
of thyself to thy people, as thou hast done in all ages; and
in particular, we give thanks at the remembrance of thine
holiness: Thou mightest, indeed, have glorified thy name in
the everlasting destruction of the whole race of fallen man;
but thou hast sanctified thy name, and advanced thy perfections
in bringing about the work of our redemption by a
Mediator, in which justice and mercy are met together,
righteousness and peace have embraced each other; and
thou hast hereby a greater revenue of glory redounding to
thy name, than by all thine other works, or than could have
been brought to thee by the united services of the most excellent
creatures. We also bless thee that thou hast been
pleased to make those bright discoveries of thyself in thy
word, which thou hast magnified above all thy name; that
thou hast given us thy gospel, and all the ordinances and
means of grace, that hereby thou mayest gather to thyself a
people out of the world, who might be holy in all conversation,
as thou who hast called them art holy. We confess,
that we have not sanctified thy name as we ought, nor attended
on thine ordinances with that reverence and holy fear
that is due to thy divine Majesty, for which thou hast testified
thy displeasure against us, in withdrawing thy presence
from thine own institutions. We acknowledge that herein
thou art righteous, and hast punished us less than our iniquities
have deserved; for thou mightest have removed thy
candlestick out of its place, or taken thine ordinances from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>us, as thou hast done from many, who once worshipped thee,
as we do at this day, but are now wholly estranged from thee.
Revive thy work, O Lord, we beseech thee, and hereby sanctify
thy great name: Let thy word have free course, and be
glorified: Set up thy standard against every thing that opposes
thine interest in the world; send forth thy light and
thy truth, whereby the ignorant may be instructed in the
way of salvation by Christ. Give a check to that atheism,
profaneness, and irreligion that abounds among a professing
people; and let all the dispensations of thy providence have
a tendency to bring about the work of reformation, that thereby
thou mayest be glorified, and thy people enabled, more
and more, to sanctify thee in every thing, whereby thou makest
thyself known.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CXCI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXCI.</span> <i>What do we pray for in the second petition?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> In the second petition, [which is, <i>Thy kingdom come</i>,]
acknowledging ourselves, and all mankind to be, by nature,
under the dominion of sin and Satan; we pray that the kingdom
of sin and Satan may be destroyed, the gospel propagated
throughout the world, the Jews called, the fulness of
the Gentiles brought in, the church furnished with all gospel
officers and ordinances, purged from corruption, countenanced
and maintained by the civil magistrate, that the ordinances
of Christ may be purely dispensed and made effectual
to the converting of those that are yet in their sins, and
the confirming, comforting, and building up of those that are
already converted; that Christ would rule in our hearts here,
and hasten the time of his second coming, and our reigning
with him for ever; and that he would be pleased so to exercise
the kingdom of his power in all the world, as may
best conduce to these ends.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this petition there are,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Some things supposed, relating to the sovereignty and
dominion of God over men, and the position that it meets with,
which, how great soever it be, shall not hinder its advancement
in the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. There are several things which we are directed to pray
for, relating thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. As to those things that are supposed, we may consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That God is a great and glorious King. This is the necessary
result of his being the Creator of all things; from
whence arises an universal propriety in them, and a right to
dispose of them at his pleasure, in the methods of his providence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>so that he can no more lose his right to govern the
world, than he can cease to be God. It may be farther observed,
that the subjects governed are intelligent creatures; for,
though all other things are upheld by him, and made use of to
fulfil his pleasure; yet they cannot be said to be under a law,
or the subjects of moral government. Therefore God is more
especially related to angels and men as their King; and as to
that branch of his government, which is exercised in this lower
world, it principally respects men. Now when God is said to
be their King, the exercise of his dominion is variously considered,
according to the different circumstances in which they
are.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) As men, they are the subjects of his providential kingdom;
in which respect they are not only the objects of his care
and common goodness, which extends itself, as the Psalmist
says, to <i>all his works</i>, Psal. cxlv. 9. or, as he <i>gives to all, life
and breath, and all things</i>, Acts xvii. 25. But, whatever he
does in the world, is, some way or other, designed for their
use or advantage, either as subservient to their happiness, or as
objects, in which they behold the glory of his divine perfections
that shines forth therein; and, in this respect, as the God
of nature, he is King over the whole world, whose glory infinitely
surpasses that of the greatest monarch on earth. When
men are said to have dominion, they derive it from his will and
providence: It is also limited; whereas his is universal. And
they are accountable to him for the administration of that authority,
which he commits to them: But he giveth no account
of his matters to any one; inasmuch as there is none superior
to him. Moreover, there are many flaws and imperfections
in the government of the best kings on earth; because their
wisdom, holiness, power, and justice are imperfect; and sometimes
the most desirable ends are not attained thereby: But, on
the other hand, the divine government is such as tends to set
forth God’s glorious perfections, and answer the highest ends,
to wit, the advancement of his own name, in promoting the
welfare of his creatures. We may also observe, that the
greatest potentates on earth, are not only mortal, but their
government is often subject to change, and liable to be resisted
and controuled, by other kings like themselves: Whereas God
has none equal with him; therefore his government cannot be
controuled; and being all-sufficient, he cannot be destitute of
what is necessary to fulfil his purpose, or advance his glory.
Again, none but God has a right to give laws to the consciences
of men; and, indeed, no government is properly spiritual,
and such as reaches the heart like his; nor does the honour
that is due to any other, contain in it, the least right to divine
worship or adoration which belongs only to him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>(2.) As God has a peculiar people in the world, who are the
objects of his grace, these are the subjects of Christ’s mediatorial
kingdom, in which respect he is styled King of saints.
This is not only a divine honour which we ascribe to him; but
it belongs to him in particular as our Redeemer: and so it is
to be understood whenever he is called a King in scripture, as
denoting that kingdom which he has received from his Father;
whereas his right to govern the world, which is styled his providential
kingdom, necessarily belongs to him as God, and is
no more conferred upon him by the will of his Father, than
his divine nature or personality: We do not therefore pray in
this petition, that he would govern the world; for we may all
well address ourselves to him, that he would be an infinite
Sovereign, and act agreeably to his divine nature, which he cannot
but be and do. But the kingdom which is here intended,
which we have a more immediate regard to, as the subject-matter
of this petition, is, that which belongs to him as Mediator,
which he received from the Father; who is said, in this
respect, to have <i>set him</i> as <i>his King upon his holy hill of Zion</i>,
Psal. ii. 6. concerning whom it was foretold, that <i>the government</i>
should <i>be upon his shoulder</i>, Isa. ix. 6. This is therefore
not only an honour, but an office which he is invested with,
having received a commission from the Father, to execute it;
and whenever he is said to do any thing in the methods of his
providence, which have an immediate reference to the salvation
of his people, it contains in it the exercise of his dominion, or
is a branch of the glory of his Mediatorial kingdom; and this
is what we have a peculiar regard to, when we desire that his
kingdom may come. In this respect we pray, that all the dispensations
of his providence may tend to the application of
that redemption which is purchased for his people; and in
particular, that he would subdue them to himself, take possession
of their hearts, govern them by his laws, defend them by
his power, restrain and conquer all their enemies, and, at last,
admit them to inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the
foundation of the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the New Testament Christ’s kingdom is generally taken
for the gospel-dispensation; in which he is represented as sitting
on a throne of grace, and sinners are invited to come and
bow down before him, and receive the blessings that he encourages
them to expect, as their merciful Sovereign. This
kingdom of grace shall not cease to be administered by him,
till all his redeemed ones are made willing, in the day of his
power, and, pursuant thereunto, brought into a better world;
and then it will receive another denomination, as called, the
kingdom of heaven. It is true, the gospel-dispensation is often
so called in the New Testament, as it respects the administration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>of his gracious government begun and carried on in
this world; whereas, in heaven, it will be administered in a
most glorious manner, agreeably to that state of perfection to
which his saints shall be brought; But these things having
been particularly insisted on under a foregoing answer, in
which Christ’s Kingly office was explained<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c012'><sup>[115]</sup></a>; we shall pass
them over at present, and proceed to consider another thing
supposed in this petition, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>2. That though God be the only supreme and lawful Sovereign,
yet there are some who pretend to stand in competition
with, and usurp that dominion which belongs only to him.
Accordingly man no sooner rebelled against him, but he was
under the dominion of sin, and was inclined to serve divers
lusts and pleasures, and willingly gave himself over as a vassal
of Satan, who, from that time, was styled <i>the prince</i>, or god <i>of
this world, the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience</i>,
John xii. 31. 2 Cor. iv. 4. Eph. ii. 2. We must not
suppose that he has the least right to this kingdom, or dominion,
in which he sets himself against the divine government;
yet sinners who rebel against God, are said to be Satan’s subjects.
Where the gospel is not preached, he reigns without
controul; and false churches, that oppose the faith contained
therein, are called, <i>Synagogues of Satan</i>, Rev. ii. 9. and, indeed,
in all those places, where Christ’s kingdom of grace doth
not extend itself, there persons are said to be subjects of Satan’s
kingdom; which is opposed to it. These two kingdoms
divide the world; therefore, when we pray, that Christ’s kingdom
may be advanced, this includes in it an earnest desire,
that whatsoever has a tendency to oppose it, may be ruined
and destroyed. And this leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. What we are to pray for in this petition. Here let it be
observed, that we are not to pray, that God would govern the
world, or exercise his providential kingdom, for that he cannot
but do; neither are we to pray that Christ’s kingdom may
come, in the same sense in which the church prayed for it, before
the gospel-dispensation, which is called his kingdom, was
erected; since that would be, in effect, to deny that there is
such a kingdom; or, that our Saviour has a church, in which
he exercises his government in the world: Nevertheless, we
are to pray, that God would eminently display his perfections
for the good of his people, in his providential government of
the world, and over-rule all the dispensations thereof, for the
advancement of his own name, and the happiness of his church
and people; and though (as we have but now observed) we
are not to pray that the gospel-dispensation may be erected;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>yet we are to pray that Christ’s spiritual kingdom may be farther
extended, subjects daily brought into it, and the blessed
fruits and effects thereof, which tend to promote his own glory,
and his people’s happiness may be abundantly experienced
by them: But, that we may more particularly explain the several
things contained in this answer, which respect the subject-matter
of our prayers, when we say, <i>Thy kingdom come</i>,
we express our desire,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That the kingdom of sin and Satan may be destroyed:
This Christ will certainly do in his own time, inasmuch as it
is directly opposite to his kingdom. The Devil’s chief design
is to draw Christ’s subjects off from their allegiance to him:
Therefore he will certainly plead his own cause, that his enemies
may not take occasion to insult him, as though they had
gained a victory over the Almighty. Moreover, his holiness
and justice obliges him to do this; for since Satan’s kingdom
is supported by sin’s gaining strength, and this tends to cast a
reproach on the divine perfections; it must be destroyed.
And to this we may add, that every one who is converted, is,
(as the apostle says) <i>delivered from the power of darkness, and
delivered into the kingdom of God’s dear Son</i>, Col. i. 13. Therefore
we pray, that Christ’s interest may flourish in the world,
which includes in it a desire, that whatsoever is contrary to it,
may be thrown down.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are various steps and degrees whereby Satan’s kingdom
has been, and shall be weakened, till it shall be, at last,
wholly destroyed.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) It met with a great shock when the first gospel promise
was given to Adam in paradise, relating to the <i>seed of the woman
bruising the serpent’s head</i>, Gen. iii. 15. or Christ’s
coming to defeat this deep-laid design against the interest of
God in the world, by giving him a total defeat to him that was
at the head thereof. Till this promise was given, there could
not be the least hope of salvation for fallen man; whose condition
was not only deplorable, but desperate, and, in all appearance,
remediless; but by this first display of divine grace,
a door of hope was opened, and Satan’s kingdom began to be
broken and demolished.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) It met with a farther shock, when men began to lay
hold of, and take encouragement from this promise, and public
worship was set up in the world; and the coming of the
Messiah, who was expected to appear in our nature, and in the
fulness of time, to destroy the works of the Devil, was farther
made known to the church, and clearer intimations given of
the glory of his Person, and the offices he was to execute, by
which means he was regarded as the object of their faith, who
waited for, and earnestly desired the gospel-day, when all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>types and prophesies relating thereunto, should have their accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Satan’s kingdom met with a very great defeat, when
Christ, who was the desire of all nations, took our nature,
and dwelt among us, and, in the whole course of his ministry,
discovered the way of salvation to his people, more clearly than
it had been in former ages, and finished the work of redemption
in his death, whereby he paid an infinite price for his elect, to
divine justice; and at the same time, <i>destroyed him that had the
power of death, that is the Devil</i>, Heb. ii. 14. or, as it is expressed
elsewhere, <i>spoiled principalities, and powers, openly triumphing
over them in his cross</i>, Col. ii. 17. And when he
was raised from the dead, whereby the work that he came
about was brought to perfection, Satan’s kingdom was so effectually
destroyed, that he shall not be able to maintain that dominion
which he had over them, who before were his vassals,
but are now become Christ’s subjects by right of redemption.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) The success of the gospel, in the various ages since our
Saviour was here on earth; his gathering and building up his
church, defeating all the attempts of his enemies, who have
threatened its ruin; so that the gates of hell have not been
able to prevail against it; and its having been favoured with
his special presence, and the means of grace bestowed upon,
and continued to it, together with the various instances of that
success that has attended them, have all had a tendency to
weaken and destroy Satan’s kingdom.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) All the victories that believers are enabled to obtain
over sin, and Satan’s temptations; and all the graces that they
have exercised, and comforts that they have experienced, are
a gradual weakening of Satan’s kingdom, though the victory
over him, at present, be not complete, inasmuch as he has too
great an interest in the hearts of God’s people, through the remainders
of corruption; yet they shall, at last, be made more
than conquerors over him; and the fruits and consequences of
the victory that Christ has obtained over him, shall be perfectly
applied.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. In desiring that Christ’s kingdom may come, we pray
that the gospel may be propagated throughout the world, the
Jews called, and the fulness of the Gentiles brought in. When
the gospel-dispensation, which is Christ’s kingdom was first
erected; the apostles, who were employed in this important
work, were to fulfil that commission which he gave them, in
preaching the gospel to all nations, which accordingly they
did, and, by the extraordinary hand of God that attended it, it
was spread, in a short space of time through a considerable
part of the world; many of the Jews were called, among
whom all that were ordained to eternal life, believed; and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>for the Gentiles, who, before this, were unacquainted with the
way of salvation, they had Christ preached to them, and many
churches were gathered from among them; by which means his
kingdom was advanced, and a foundation laid, for the propagation
and flourishing state of the gospel in all succeeding ages,
the effects whereof are experienced at this day. Therefore,
when this petition relating to the coming of Christ’s kingdom,
was used by those who lived at this time, when our Saviour
gave this direction about it; that which was principally intended
thereby, was, that Christ might be preached to the Gentiles,
and believed on in the world; that the veil, or the face
of the covering that was spread over all nations, might be taken
away, and the way of salvation might be known by them, who,
before this, sat in the region and shadow of death: Though,
when it is used by us, we signify our desire that this invaluable
blessing may be still continued, and the promises relating to
the greater success thereof, may have a more full accomplishment.
The apostles, indeed, in executing their commission,
are said to have preached the gospel to all nations, that is, to
a very considerable part of the heathen world: However, it
does not appear that every individual nation of the world has
been yet favoured with this privilege; and therefore, what was
foretold concerning the <i>earth’s being full of the knowledge of
the Lord, as the waters cover the sea</i>, Isa. xi. 9. and other predictions
to the like purpose, do not seem hitherto to have had
their full accomplishment<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c012'><sup>[116]</sup></a>. And it is very evident, that many
nations, who once had the gospel preached to them by the
apostles, are now wholly destitute of it. And though it is
true, a considerable number of the Jews at first, believed in
Christ; yet the greatest part of that nation were cast off, and
all remain, at this day, strangers and enemies to him: Therefore
we cannot but suppose, that those prophecies which respect
their conversion, in the latter day, together with the fulness
of the Gentiles being brought in, shall be more eminently accomplished
than they have hitherto been<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c012'><sup>[117]</sup></a>. This is therefore
what we are to pray for when we say, <i>Thy kingdom come</i>; and,
in order thereto, we are to be importunate with God,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That his interest may be still maintained, and the glory
may not depart from his church; but that it may still enjoy the
ordinances of his grace, and those privileges by which it is distinguished
from the world, notwithstanding all the attempts of
hell, and persecuting powers to undermine and overthrow it.
And, though it be brought to a very low ebb at this day, that
he would revive his work in the midst of the years, till he be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>pleased to cause that glorious day to dawn, which his people
are now desiring, waiting and hoping for; and in order hereunto,
we are to pray,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) That there may be a more plentiful effusion of the Spirit,
which is absolutely necessary to the advancement of Christ’s
kingdom; a farther reformation of the church, and a greater
spread of the gospel in those nations where it is not known at
present.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) We are to pray, that the church may be furnished with
all gospel-officers and ordinances that are necessary hereunto.
Not that we are to pray, that new ordinances may be instituted,
which, at present, are not known, which we have no warrant
from scripture to expect; but that God, by the good hand
of his providence, would send his ordinances, namely, the
word, sacraments and prayer, which are his outward and ordinary
means of salvation, into those parts of the world, which
are, at present, strangers to them. Accordingly we are to
pray,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That whereever God has a people who thirst after the
word, but enjoy not the preaching thereof, especially with that
zeal and clearness as is necessary to their spiritual advantage
and edification in Christ, that he would send faithful labourers
among them, that their souls may not pine, starve, and be in
danger of perishing, for lack of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] That where the word of God has been preached with
success, so that many believe in Christ, who, nevertheless, have
not the advantage of walking together, for their mutual edification,
in a church-relation, that God would over-rule and order
matters so, that they who have given up themselves to the
Lord, may encourage and strengthen the hands of one another,
by joining together in religious societies, owning Christ’s
kingly government, and worshipping him in all those ordinances
which he has given to his churches. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] That there may be proper officers, spirited, qualified,
and raised up, in subserviency thereunto; that there may be
a constant supply of <i>pastors according to his heart, which shall
feed with knowledge and understanding</i>, Jer. iii. 15. These
are necessary to the well-being of a church; and though extraordinary
gifts are not to be expected, in like manner as God
was pleased to bestow them on his apostles in the first planting
of the gospel; yet there are some gifts which Christ has purchased,
and we are to pray for, that are particularly adapted to
the furnishing them, who are called to minister as officers in
his churches, for the promoting his cause and interest therein,
and thereby advancing his spiritual kingdom.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) We are to pray, that the church may be purged from
those corruptions that tend to defile, and are a great reproach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>to it, and very unbecoming the relation that it stands in to
Christ. It is not, indeed, to be supposed, that any church in
the world, is so pure that there are no corruptions in it, which
appear to the eye of the heart-searching God: But some are
visible to the world, being notorious and inconsistent, not only
with the purity, but, if allowed of, with the very being of a
church of Christ; which are matter of lamentation to the
godly, and a reproach to those who are chargeable therewith;
and, as the apostle styles them, <i>a root of bitterness springing
up and troubling</i> them, whereby many are <i>defiled</i>, Heb. xii. 15.
These corruptions are either such as respect the faith, or conversation
of professors.</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] As to what respects corruption in matters of faith.
These consist in the denying the most important doctrines,
which are necessary to be known and believed, in order to our
salvation; and with respect hereunto, we are to pray, that
Christians may not depart from the faith, which was once delivered
to the saints, being <i>carried about with divers and
strange doctrines</i>, chap. xiii. 9. or, as it is said elsewhere, <i>soon
removed from him that called them into the grace of Christ unto
another gospel</i>, Gal. i. 6. We are also to pray, that he would
root out those errors and heresies which are inconsistent with
the church’s purity; and have a greater tendency to bring about
its ruin than all the persecutions it can meet with from its
most enraged enemies.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] There are other corruptions that more especially respect
the conversation of those who are called Christians, that walk
not as becomes the gospel of Christ, by which means there is
no visible difference between the church and the world: Thus
the apostle tells the church at Corinth, 1 Cor. iii. 3. that some
of them were <i>carnal and walked as men</i>; that is, notwithstanding
the profession of religion that they made, in their conversation
they differed little from the men of the world: And he
also speaks of others who <i>profess that they know God, but in
works deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unto every
good work reprobate</i>, Tit. i. 16. Now, with respect to these,
we are to pray, that their profession may be adorned by a holy
life; that none may cast a stumbling-block in the way of these
who watch for their haltings, and are glad to take all opportunities
to improve the falls and miscarriages of Christians against
them; and that God, by his providence, or rather, by his Spirit,
poured out from on high, would refine and purify his
church, <i>purge away the dross, and take away all the tin</i>, as the
prophet expresses it, Isa. i. 25.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) We are farther to pray, that the ordinances of Christ
may be purely administered, without any mixture of human
inventions, which tend to debase, and are far from adding any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>beauty or glory to them. It is natural, indeed, for man to be
fond of, and pleased with, those ordinances, which take their
rise from himself; but God, who is jealous for the purity of
his own worship, can in no wise approve of them, and they are
so far from advancing Christ’s kingdom, that God reckons it
no other than <i>setting our threshold by his thresholds</i>, and <i>our
post by his</i>, which he calls <i>a defiling his holy name, by the
abominations which they</i> herein <i>commit</i>, which will be the
ground and reason of his <i>consuming them in his anger</i>, Ezek.
xliii. 8. Therefore, we are to pray, that whatever intrudes itself
into any branch of the worship of God, as not receiving
any warrant or sanction from himself, may be removed out of
the way, that hereby his church may be reformed, and its destruction
prevented.</p>

<p class='c006'>(6.) We are to pray, that the church may be encouraged by
civil magistrates, that their government may be subservient to
Christ’s spiritual kingdom; that, according to God’s promise,
<i>kings may be</i> its <i>nursing fathers, and their queens</i> its <i>nursing
mothers</i>, Isa. xlix. 23. that, by this means, it may have peace
and safety, and not be exposed, as it has often been, to the
rage and fury of persecuting powers; and also, that magistrates
may be guardians, not only of the civil, but religious
liberties of their subjects, which is necessary to complete the
happiness of a nation, and bring down many blessings from
God upon it. We are also to pray, that God would not only
incline them to advance religion, by rendering the administration
of civil government, subservient thereunto, but that, by a
steady adherence to it themselves, they may strengthen the
hands of the faithful, and encourage many others to embrace
it: And if, on the other hand, they are disposed to exercise
their power, in such a way, as tends to the discountenancing
religion, and weakening the hands of those who profess it; we
are to pray, that God would over-rule their counsels, and incline
them to deal favourably with those who desire stedfastly to
adhere to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>(7.) We are taught, in this petition, to pray, that the means
of grace may be made effectual to the converting of sinners,
and to the confirming, comforting, and building up of believers;
that a great and effectual door may be opened for the
success of the gospel, and that it may <i>come not in word only,
but also in power</i>, 1 Thess. i. 3. so that, by this means, the
Lord would be pleased to add to the church daily, such as
shall be saved, that hereby Christ’s government, or spiritual
kingdom, may be promoted in the hearts of his people, and
they enabled to testify a ready and willing subjection to his
authority, and yield obedience to him, with all the powers and
faculties of their souls.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>(8.) We are to pray for the advancement of Christ’s kingdom,
at his second and glorious coming; when the work of
grace shall be brought to its utmost perfection; and all the
elect, who shall have lived from the beginning to the end of
time, shall be gathered together, and brought into Christ’s
kingdom of glory, as they have formerly been into his kingdom
of grace, when the highest honours shall be conferred upon
them, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever. As
the church, under the Old Testament-dispensation, prayed
that Christ’s kingdom of grace might come, <i>viz.</i> be administered,
as it has been, and now is, under the gospel-dispensation,
and, as it is expressed, that he would <i>be like a roe, or like a
young hart upon the mountains of Bether</i>, Cant. ii. 17. or, that
the desire of all nations would fill his house with glory: So
the New Testament-church is represented as praying, that
Christ would <i>come quickly</i>, according to his promise, Rev. xxii.
20. and put a final period to every thing that has had a tendency
to detract from the glory of his kingdom, or the happiness of
his subjects; and, in order hereunto, we must pray, that the
elect, who are Christ’s mystical body, may be gathered, and
brought in to him; and then we may be sure that he will hasten
his coming. And, till this is done, we are to wait patiently,
as the <i>husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the
earth</i>, in the desired harvest, James v. 7. and, in the mean
time, we are to pray, that he would be pleased to exert his
power, and make the dispensations of his providence in the
world, conducive to answer these ends, and more particularly,
with respect to ourselves; that hereby we may have, not only
an habitual, but an actual meetness for the heavenly kingdom;
that when our Lord shall come, we may not be like those
virgins mentioned in the parable, who <i>all slumbered and slept</i>,
Matt. xxv. 5. but, upon the first alarm, may go out to meet
him with joy and triumph; and, as an evidence hereof, that
we may be enabled to walk as <i>strangers and pilgrims on the
earth</i>, or, as those who <i>desire a better country, that is, an heavenly</i>,
Heb. xi. 13, 16. and that we may keep up an intercourse
with Christ, that we may be ready to entertain him with delight
and pleasure, whenever he comes; that when he, who is
our Life, our Hope, and Saviour, as well as our King, shall
appear, we may appear with him in glory. Thus concerning
the administration of Christ’s Kingly government, as the subject-matter
of this petition: And, that we may be farther assisted
in directing our prayers to God agreeable thereunto, we
may consider his children as addressing themselves to him to
this purpose: “We adore and magnify thee, O God our Saviour,
as the Governor of the world; who dost according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>thy will in the armies of heaven, and amongst the inhabitants
of the earth. Thy power is irresistible, and thy works wonderful:
But it is matter of the highest astonishment, that
thou should exercise that gracious government, in which
thou condescendest to be called the King of saints. What
is man, that thou shouldst thus magnify him, and set thine
heart upon him; that they, whom thou mightest have dealt
with as traitors, and enemies to thy government, and, as
such, have ruled them with a rod of iron, and broken them
in pieces, like a potter’s vessel, should be admitted to partake
of the privileges which thou art pleased to bestow on
thy servants and subjects! Thou hast often invited us, by
holding forth thy sceptre of grace, to come and acknowledge
thee to be our Lord and Sovereign; but our hearts have
been filled with rebellion against thee. We have served
divers lusts and pleasures, and been in confederacy with
hell and death, yielding ourselves slaves to Satan, thine
avowed enemy: But now, we desire to cast ourselves down
before thy foot-stool; and, while we stand amazed at thy
clemency, we accept of the overture of a pardon which
thou hast made in the gospel, with the greatest thankfulness,
accounting it our highest privilege, as well as our indispensable
duty, to be thy subjects. Write thy law, we
beseech thee, in our hearts; bring down every high thought
and imagination, which sets itself against thine interest, and
make us entirely willing to be thy servants, devoted to thy
fear. We also beg, that thou wouldst take to thyself thy
great power and reign. Let Satan’s kingdom be destroyed,
thy gospel propagated throughout the world. May thine
ancient people, the Jews, who now refuse that thou shouldst
reign over them, be called and inclined to own thee as their
King; and may the dark parts of the earth see thy salvation.
Reform thy churches; let them be constantly supplied with
those who shall go in and out before them, and shall feed
them with knowledge and understanding. May they be
purged from those corruptions which are a reproach to thy
government; let not the commandments of men be received,
instead of thine holy institutions; may thine ordinances be
purely dispensed, that thy people may have ground to hope
for thy presence therein; and may they be made effectual for
the converting of sinners, and establishing thy saints in their
holy faith. And let all the dispensations of thy providence
in the world, have a tendency to advance thy kingdom of
grace, that, as thou hast, in all ages, appeared in the behalf of
thy church and people; so it may be preserved and carried
through all the difficulties that it meets with, and be secured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>from the attempts of thine enemies against it, till they who
rejoice in thy government here, shall be received into thy
heavenly kingdom hereafter.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CXCII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXCII.</span> <i>What do we pray for in the third petition?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> In the third petition, [which is, <i>Thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven</i>] acknowledging that, by nature, we,
and all men, are not only utterly unable and unwilling to
know and do the will of God, but prone to rebel against his
word, to repine and murmur against his providence, and
wholly inclined to do the will of the flesh, and of the Devil:
We pray, that God would by his Spirit, take away from ourselves
and others, all blindness, weakness, indisposedness, and
perverseness of heart, and by his grace make us able and
willing to know, do, and submit to his will in all things, with
the like humility, cheerfulness, faithfulness, diligence, zeal,
sincerity, and constancy, as the angels do in heaven.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the understanding of this petition, we must enquire,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. What is meant by the will of God, and how it is said
to be done by us. We have, under a foregoing answer, considered<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c012'><sup>[118]</sup></a>,
that this is distinguished into his secret and revealed
will, and shewn that as the former of these is the reason of his
own actings, and determines the event of things; the latter is
what we are more especially concerned about, as it is a rule of
duty to us. It is also farther distinguished into his perceptive
and providential will; the former of which we are to obey; the
latter, to admire, submit to, and be well pleased with: Accordingly,
when we pray, <i>Thy will be done</i>, we desire, that his laws
might be obeyed, and thereby his universal dominion, and right
to govern the world, practically acknowledged; and that, by
this means, sin might be prevented, and this earth might not
become so much like hell as it would be, in this method, which
God has taken to direct our actions, and give a check to our
corruptions, were wholly disregarded by us. When we consider
God as the Creator of man, the next idea we have of him
is, that he exercises his dominion and sovereignty in giving
laws to him; which he is under a natural obligation to obey;
otherwise he disowns himself to be a creature, or a subject,
which is the highest affront that can be offered to the divine
Majesty, and exposes him to that punishment which is due to
those who are found in open rebellion against him: This is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>what we are to pray against in this petition, in which there is
something supposed, namely,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c012'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>1. That his will must be known by us, otherwise it cannot
be obeyed. And this supposes the law to be promulgated;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>which has been already done; particularly as it was written
by God on the heart of man at first, in such legible characters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>that our apostacy from him has not wholly erased it. But besides
this, there must be an internal impression made on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>minds and consciences of men, whereby they may be brought
to see the excellency and glory thereof, and their indispensable
obligation to yield obedience thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>2. It is farther supposed, that the will of man is naturally
averse, and disinclined, to obey the divine commands, which
is the result of our fall and apostacy from God; and, through
the corruption of our nature, we are prone to say, <i>Who is lord
over us</i>, Psal. xii. 4. and, <i>What is the Almighty, that we should
serve him</i>, Job xxi. 15. This is the source of all that opposition
which the heart of man expresses against the laws of God,
while sinners entertain a fixed resolution to give laws to themselves;
and, on the other hand, are wholly inclined to do the
will of the flesh and of the Devil: This the apostle calls <i>fulfilling
the desires of the flesh and of the mind</i>; while at the
same time, they <i>walk according to the prince of the power of the
air, the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience</i>, Eph.
ii. 2, 3. This will of the flesh is agreeable to the dictates of
Satan, by whom it is content to be kept in perpetual bondage;
his suggestions are agreeable to the corruption of nature;
whereas, the command of God being contrary to it, as containing
in them the signatures of his holiness, are grievous and
burdensome to fallen man; the law is spiritual, and therefore
it cannot be agreeable to those who are carnal, and, as it were
sold under sin. And this discovers itself,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) In that, sinful man is determined to do, not what is
lawful, but what is pleasing to himself, not considering what
he ought to do, as being accountable to God, the judge of all
for his behaviour in this world; but whether it is agreeable to
his own inclinations, and affords some present delight to his
carnal appetite.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) As for Satan, he uses his utmost endeavours to strengthen
these resolutions, and increase the depravity and corruption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>of our nature; and, for this end, daily presents objects to our
imaginations, that are agreeable to the desires of the flesh; and
these are received with pleasure and delight, whereby a snare
is laid for the ruin of the soul, so that it becomes more and
more alienated from the life of God; and not only indifferent,
as to matters of religion, but utterly averse to them. This is
the reason of all the dishonour that is brought to God in the
world; whereby it appears, that his will is not done therein, as
it ought to be.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, as the will of man sets itself against the commanding
will of God, so it expresses the same aversion to his
providential will; which is not said indeed, to be done, but it
ought to be submitted to, by us. We are as much inclined to
find fault with what God does in the world, as we are to rebel
against his law. This appears in our being discontented and
uneasy with the allotments of providence, especially when we
are under the afflicting hand of God; whereby we are apt to
charge him as dealing hardly with us, because we have not
those opportunities, we desire, to fulfil the lusts of the flesh,
or some check is given to our corrupt appetites or inclinations.
How ready are we to complain of injuries done us, as though
God were obliged to give us whatever we would have, how
contrary soever it may be to our real good and advantage, as
well as his own glory! Of this we have many instances, in
the perverse behaviour of the children of Israel in the wilderness,
who were frequently complaining of the hardships they
endured; and, by their murmuring against God, provoked him
to send those terrible judgments which, as they might have
foreseen, would be the consequence thereof. This is the most
unreasonable behaviour towards him, who has a right to do
what he will with his own, and directly contrary to that temper
of mind which the gospel suggests; whereby we are taught,
in whatsoever state or condition of life we are, therewith to be
contented. It is, in both these respects, that we are instructed,
in this petition, to pray, that <i>the will of the Lord</i> may
<i>be done</i>. Which leads us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. The subject-matter of what we are taught to pray for in
this petition, when we say, <i>Thy will be done</i>. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. With respect to God’s commanding will, we are to pray,
that he would incline and enable us to yield obedience to it;
and accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) We are to be earnest with him, that he would remove
the ignorance and blindness of our minds, that we may see a
beauty and glory in every thing that he commands; for, next
to the Sovereignty of God, which is the first motive hereunto,
the excellency of what he commands is to be considered as an
inducement to obedience. Therefore we are to be convinced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>that his <i>law is holy, his commandment holy, just, and good</i>,
Rom. vii. 12. or, that duty and interest are herein inseparably
connected, so that the one can never be secured without the
other. This is the work of the Spirit of God, when he directs
and leads us in the way wherein we ought to walk.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We are to pray, that God would take away the obstinacy
and perverseness of our wills, that our obedience may be
matter of choice, and performed with delight, otherwise it
cannot be pleasing to him; and accordingly we are to pray,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That it may be performed with the utmost sincerity, as
approving ourselves not to men, but God, who searcheth the
heart; and that it may proceed from a principle of spiritual
life and grace, and be done with a single eye, to his glory,
whose we are, and whom we desire to serve.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] We are to pray, that our obedience may arise from a
filial fear of God, and a love to him, and not barely a dread
of punishment, or fear of his wrath, as the consequence of our
rebellion against him; or from a mercenary frame of spirit,
that looks at nothing farther than some advantages which we
expect to receive from him; and that it may also proceed from
a sense of gratitude for the many benefits which we receive
from him, whereby we are, as it were, constrained to do his
will.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] This obedience ought to be universal, with respect to
the matter thereof, and constant, with respect to our perseverance
therein. We are not to choose to obey some of the
divine commands, and refuse others; or to perform those duties
which are most easy, and reject those that are difficult; or
to obey the will of God, so far as it comports with our secular
interest, and indent with him to be excused in those things that
are inconsistent therewith: but we must leave it to him alone,
to prescribe the matter of duty, and express an entire compliance
therewith, whatsoever it be that he requires. Thus the
Psalmist says, <i>Then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect
unto all thy commandments</i>, Psal. cxix. 6.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, this obedience must be constant, without our
growing cold and indifferent therein, or desisting from it, according
as our condition in the world is altered, as though we
had nothing to do with God and religion, but when we are
under some pressing difficulties; for that is to set our faces
heaven-ward for a time, and afterwards to draw back unto
perdition.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We are to pray that God would enable us to submit to
his disposing will, as being satisfied that all the dispensations
of his providence are right; and accordingly to say, with David,
<i>Here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good to him</i>, 2 Sam.
xv. 26. This consists,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>[1.] In maintaining a quiet, easy, composed frame of spirit,
fitted for the exercise of religious duties, though under trying
dispensations of providence.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] When we justify God, and lay the blame on ourselves,
whatever afflictions we are exercised with. Thus the Psalmist
speaks of himself as deserted, and God as <i>far from helping
him</i>, he acknowledges the equity of his dispensations, when he
says, <i>Thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel</i>,
Pal. xxii. 1. 3. or, as he elsewhere expresses himself, <i>The Lord
is upright, he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in
him</i>, Psal. xcii. 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] When we are disposed to bless God, at the same time,
when he takes away outward mercies, as well as when he gives
them: Thus Job, when he was stripped of all he had at once,
says, <i>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be
the name of the Lord</i>, Job i. 24. We are now to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The manner in which the will of God is to be done:
Accordingly we are taught to pray, that it may be <i>done in
earth as it is in heaven</i>; not that we are to suppose that the
best of saints can arrive, while in this world, to the perfection
of the heavenly state; so that it is possible for them to do the
will of God in the same manner, or degree, as it is done in
heaven: Therefore the particle as respects similitude, rather
than equality, and all that we can infer from hence is, that
there is some analogy or resemblance between the obedience of
the saints here, and that of the inhabitants of heaven. This
implies in it a desire,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That it may be done with great humility and reverence.
Thus the angels, who have the character of Seraphims, are
represented, in that emblem or vision which the prophet Isaiah
saw, of the <i>Lord sitting on his throne</i>, Isa. vi. 1, 2. and the
<i>Seraphims</i> attending him, as having their <i>faces covered with
their wings</i>, in token of reverence and humility. And others
are described as <i>casting their crowns before the throne</i>, Rev.
vi. 10. intimating, that all the glory that is put upon them, is
derived from him that sits on the throne, and that their honour
is not to be regarded or mentioned, when compared with him
who is the fountain thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. This expression farther implies in it a desire to do the
will of God with all cheerfulness. Some think that this is intended
in the vision which John saw concerning the seven angels,
who were employed to inflict the seven last plagues on
the church’s enemies, when they are represented as doing it
with <i>harps in their hands</i>, and as singing the praises of God at
the same time, Rev. xv. 1-3.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We are said to do the will of God on earth, as it is done
by the angels in heaven, when we do it with faithfulness: Thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>when they are represented as ministering to God’s people, and,
as such, having the charge over them to keep them in all their
ways, they are spoken of as doing this faithfully; as it is said,
<i>They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
against a stone</i>, Psal. xci. 11, 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The angels are farther represented as a pattern of diligence
in doing the will of God: Thus it is said of the angel
Gabriel, that when the word of command was given him to
carry a message to Daniel, he <i>fled swiftly</i>, being expeditious
in fulfilling the work he was employed about, Dan. ix. 21.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. They are said to do the will of God, with zeal and fervency;
and, for this reason, some think they are called, in the
scripture but now mentioned, <i>seraphims</i>; or, as they are elsewhere
styled, <i>A flaming fire</i>, Psal. civ. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. The angels are said to do the will of God sincerely: Thus
the inhabitants of heaven are represented, as having <i>no guile
found in their mouths</i>, and <i>being without fault before the throne
of God</i>, Prov. xxii. 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. They are said to do the will of God with constancy:
Thus we read of them as <i>serving him day and night in his
temple</i>, chap. vii. 15. and the angels, which are ministering spirits,
sent forth to minister unto the heirs of salvation, are said
<i>always</i> to <i>behold the face of God in heaven</i>, Mat. xviii. 10.
that is, they never give out, or are weary of his service: We
have herein an excellent example set before us, and are exhorted
to pray, that in our measure we may yield the like obedience
to God, though we fall very short of doing it, as they
do who are in a perfect state. We are therefore herein taught
to lift up our hearts to God, in a way of adoration, confession,
and supplication, <i>q. d.</i> “We acknowledge, O Lord, that thou
hast a right to the obedience of all creatures, and hast been
pleased to give them thy law as the rule thereof. It is our
glory, as well as our happiness, to be thy servants; for thy
law is holy, thy commandment holy, just and good: But we
acknowledge and confess before thee, that we have rebelled
against thee, and have refused to yield obedience to thy
commands: And when we behold the universal corruption
of human nature, we blush and are ashamed to think how
little glory is brought to thy name, by the service and obedience
of thy creatures here below. In heaven thy will is
done perfectly, by those who serve thee with the greatest delight
and pleasure; but on earth thou hast but little glory;
it is an instance of condescending goodness that thou hast
not, long since, abandoned and forsook it, and thereby rendered
it like hell: But, we beseech thee, take to thyself thy
great power, and reign in the hearts of men; subdue their
wills thyself, that they may cheerfully and constantly obey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>thy commanding will, and submit to thy providential will,
as being satisfied that all thy dispensations are right, and
shall tend to thy glory, and the welfare of all that fear thy
name.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CXCIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXCIII.</span> <i>What do we pray for in the fourth petition?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> In the fourth petition, [which is, <i>Give us this day our
daily bread</i>,] acknowledging, that in Adam, and by our sin,
we have forfeited our right to all the outward blessings of
this life, and deserve to be wholly deprived of them by God,
and to have them cursed to us in the use of them; and, that
neither they of themselves are able to sustain us, nor we to
merit, or by our own industry, to procure them, but prone
to desire, get, and use them unlawfully; we pray for ourselves
and others, that both they and we, waiting upon the
providence of God from day to day, in the use of lawful
means, may, of his free gift, and, as to his fatherly wisdom
shall seem best, enjoy a competent portion of them, and have
the same continued and blessed unto us in our holy and
comfortable use of them, and contentment in them; and be
kept from all things that are contrary to our temporal support
and comfort.</p>

<p class='c011'>In order to our understanding this petition, we must first
consider what is meant by <i>bread</i>. Some have thought that
our Saviour hereby intends spiritual mercies, as denoting that
bread which is suited to the necessities of our souls, and particularly
that we may have an interest in Christ, who is called,
<i>The bread of life</i>, John vi. 35. <i>The living bread which came
down from heaven</i>, ver. 51. But though it must be allowed,
that this is a blessing far exceeding all those that are of a
temporal nature, as much as the happiness of the soul is preferable
to that of the body; and it is, doubtless, to be made
the subject of our daily and importunate requests to God, <i>q. d.</i>
give me an interest in Christ, or else I can have no delight or
pleasure in any of the enjoyments of life: Yet this does not
seem to be intended by our Saviour in this petition; but that
bread which we pray for has a more immediate respect to the
blessings of this life, which, according to the scripture-mode
of speaking, are often set forth by <i>bread</i>. Thus God tells
Adam, after his fall, <i>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
bread</i>, Gen. iii. 19. by which we are to understand, that he
should take a great deal of pains to provide for himself the
necessaries of life. So when God promises outward blessings
to his people, he tells them, that <i>bread shall be given</i> them, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>their <i>waters shall be sure</i>, Isa. xxxiii. 16. And elsewhere, <i>I
will abundantly bless her provision; I satisfy her poor with
bread</i>, Psal. cxxxii. 15. This is what we are taught to pray for
in this petition; in which we may observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. That there are some things supposed, namely,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That, by our sins, we have forfeited a right to the outward
blessings of this life. This was the consequence of the
forfeiture of life itself; and it was a part of the curse, that we
were exposed to by our rebellion against, and apostacy from
God. If he should deprive us of all the conveniences of life,
and thereby imbitter it to us; so that we should be almost inclined
to make that unhappy choice that Job did, of <i>strangling
and death, rather than life</i>, Job vii. 15. there would be no reason
to say, there is unrighteousness with God.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It is farther supposed, that outward blessings are God’s
free gift to us. Whether we have a greater or a smaller portion
thereof, they are to be acknowledged as the fruits of
divine bounty: It is God that spreads a table for us; to some
he gives a small measure, and to others a larger share of temporal
good things; but, whatever we enjoy, it is to be owned
as the effect of his providential goodness. This, indeed, does
not exclude the use of those means that are ordained for the
preserving of life, and our obtaining the good things thereof;
but we must, at the same time, acknowledge, that all that wisdom,
industry, and success that attends our endeavours, is from
God; it is he that <i>giveth power to get wealth</i>, Deut. viii. 18.
or, as it is elsewhere said, <i>The rich and poor meet together</i>;
that is, they both agree in this, that <i>the Lord is the Maker of
them all</i>, Prov. xxii. 2. that is, whatever be their circumstances
in the world, it is he that provides, what they have, for them.
And if what we enjoy is sweetened and sanctified to us for our
good, so that we have not only the conveniences of life, but a
blessing with them, and are enabled to make a right use and
improvement of them, to the glory of God and the advantage
of ourselves and others; this must also be reckoned an instance
of divine favour, or the gift of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. It is farther supposed, that temporal good things may
lawfully be prayed for. As the providence of God does not,
as was before observed, exclude the use of means; so it is not
inconsistent with, but rather an inducement to prayer; and, indeed,
prayer is an ascribing glory to God, as the fountain of all
we enjoy; without which, it would be an affront to the divine
Majesty, to expect any blessing from him. This is applicable
to prayer in general, and, in particular, to our making supplication
for outward blessings.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. We shall consider the subject-matter of the petition, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>what we are to understand when we say, <i>Give us this day our
daily bread</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The thing prayed for, is <i>bread</i>; whereby our Saviour intimates,
that we are to set due bounds to our desires, when we
are pressing after outward blessings. He does not order us
to importune with God for the great things of this life; but
rather for those things which are necessary, in the enjoyment
whereof, we may the better be enabled to glorify him: He
does not put his followers upon asking for crowns and sceptres,
as though his kingdom were of this world, as some, who were
influenced by carnal motives, fondly imagined, being ready to
expect that many worldly advantages would accrue from their
adhering to him; and, when they found themselves mistaken,
shamefully deserted his cause, and relinquished the profession
that they once made of him: But Christ never gave his people
ground to expect that their secular interest should be promoted
by embracing the gospel: Accordingly, when any one seemed
desirous of being his disciple, he generally put this trying question
to him; whether he was content to leave all, and follow
him, or to lead a mean life in the world, and be hated of all
men for his name’s sake? His disciples, indeed, were sometimes
filled with too great solicitude about their future circumstances
in life; but he encourages them to hope for necessary
provisions, when he says, <i>Your heavenly Father knoweth
that ye have need of all these things</i>, Matt. vi. 32. and it is
always found, that where there is the greatest degree of faith,
it tends to moderate our affections as to the things of this
world; and if at any time, they are apt to exceed their due
bounds, it gives a check to them, as the prophet says to Baruch:
<i>Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not</i>, Jer.
xlv. 5. We have an admirable instance of this in Jacob; who,
when he was in a most destitute condition, flying from his
father’s house, to Padan-aram, did not know what entertainment
he should meet with there. The principal thing which he
desires, together with the divine presence and protection, is,
that he might have <i>bread to eat, and raiment to put on</i>, Gen.
xxviii. 20. He does not ask, that people and nations might
bow down to him; or that God would take away the life of
his brother Esau, whose malicious design against him, occasioned
his present hazardous journey; he is not anxiously concerned
for the great things of this world, but only desires that
he may have the necessaries of life. And Agar’s prayer is
not unlike this, who says, <i>Give me neither poverty nor riches;
feed me with food convenient for me</i>, Prov. xxx. 8. Such a
frame of spirit our Saviour supposes them to have, who thus
address themselves to God in prayer for bread, or the outward
accommodations of life.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>2. It is called, <i>our bread</i>; the meaning of which is, that
there is a distinct property which every one has, by the allotment
of providence, in those outward blessings which God has
given him, whatever be the measure or proportion thereof:
This we are taught to acknowledge with thankfulness, <i>q. d.</i>
Thou didst not design that one man should take possession of
the whole world, or engross to himself all its stores, and that
the rest should starve and perish for want of the necessaries
of life; herein thy wisdom and sovereignty appears, and to
this it is owing, that there are some things which we have a
right to, distinct from others: not without, but by the gift and
blessing of providence. And therefore, whatsoever God thinks
fit that we should receive, we call our own, and as such, pray
for it; otherwise we are not in the least to desire or covet it,
inasmuch as we are taught to pray only for that which we may
call ours, as having a natural or civil right to it, which we
have not to that which belongs to another.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now there are two ways by which we are said to receive
outward blessings, which we may call our own from the hand
of God, which are more especially included in this petition.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) As God, by his distinguishing hand, gives us that measure
of outward blessings which he sees convenient for us, and
that either, by succeeding our endeavours, or by supplying our
wants in some way which was altogether unexpected by us,
and thereby making provision for the comfort of our lives.—There
is sometimes a chain of providences concurring hereunto;
as God speaks of his <i>hearing the heavens</i>, Hos. ii. 21, 22.
that, when they want store of water, he may furnish them
therewith, and <i>they may hear the earth</i>, so as to moisten it
with showers, when parched, and becoming unfruitful; and
<i>that the earth may hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil</i>, so
as to produce them; and that <i>these may hear</i>, that is, may be
distributed among God’s people, as he sees they want them;
and the Psalmist says, <i>He watereth the hills from his chambers:
The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. He causeth
the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man;
that he may bring forth food out of the earth; And wine that
maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine,
and bread which strengthened man’s heart</i>, Psal. civ. 13-15.
So that there are various causes and effects, subservient to each
other, which are all owing to the blessing of providence, whereby
we come to possess that portion of the good things of this
life, which are allotted for us.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The outward blessings of this life may be called ours
when God is pleased to make them blessings to us, and give
us the enjoyment thereof. He must add his blessings to all
the mercies he bestows, or else they will not conduce to our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>happiness; nor can the general end, designed hereby, be answered;
without this, the bread we eat, would no more nourish
us, than husks or chaff; our garments, without this, could no
more contribute to our being warm, than if they were put upon
a statue; and the air we breathe, would rather stifle than refresh
us. Thus it is said, <i>Man doth not live by bread only, but
by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God</i>, Deut.
viii. 3. that is, not barely by second causes, or the means we
use, in order to the maintaining life and health, or any of the
comforts thereof; but, by the blessing of God, or his power
and providence, that these ends are answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>And it is he alone who can give us the comfortable enjoyment
thereof: This all have not; their tables are plentifully
furnished, but they want that measure of health which is necessary
for their taking in, or receiving advantage from them;
as it is said of the sick man, that <i>his life abhorreth bread, and
his soul dainty meat</i>, Job xxxiii. 20. Such do, as it were,
starve in the midst of plenty. And there are others, who,
though they have a great deal of the world, and are not hindered
from the enjoyment of it by the weakness or decays of
nature; yet they are made unhappy by the temper of their
minds; as there are some that abound in riches, who may, nevertheless
be said to be poor, because they want an heart to
use what they have, which is God peculiar blessing: Thus the
wise man says, <i>Every man to whom God hath given riches and
wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take
his portion, and to rejoice in his labour, this is the gift of God</i>,
Eccl. v. 19. For these things we are dependent on him; and
this is what we intend, when we pray that God would <i>give us
our bread</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We are farther taught to pray, that God would give us
our bread <i>this day</i>, thereby denoting that we are to desire to
have our present necessities supplied, as those who cannot be
certain that we shall live till to-morrow. How often does God
break the thread of our lives in an instant, without giving us
any notice of it beforehand? And therefore we may truly say
in the midst of life, we are in death, and are advised to take
no thought for the morrow, but to leave that entirely to the
providence of God: Food nourishes but for a day, so that
what we now receive will not suffice us to-morrow. Nature is
always craving supplies, and therefore we are taught to have a
continual recourse to God by prayer for them: And, if we look
farther than this present time, it is to be with this condition,
that the Lord has determined to prolong our lives, and thereby
renders it necessary for us to pray for those things that will be
needful for the support thereof: This seems to be the meaning
of that variation of expression, which the evangelist Luke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>makes use of, when he says, <i>Give us day by day our daily
bread</i>, Luke xi. 3. And it may obviate an objection, as it will
be inferred by some, that if we are not to pray for what respects
our future condition in this world, we are not to make
provision for it: Whereas, this is contrary to what we are exhorted
to do, by being led to consider the provision which the
smallest insects make for their subsistence; <i>The ant provideth
her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest</i>,
Prov. vi. 8. And the apostle says, <i>If any provide not for his
own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied
the faith, and is worse than an infidel</i>, 1 Tim. v. 8. This
therefore we ought to do; and accordingly we are to pray, that
God would succeed our lawful endeavours, in order thereunto;
though we must do it with this limitation, as maintaining a constant
sense that our times are in his hand, so that if he should
be pleased to grant us a longer or shorter lease of our lives,
which to us is altogether uncertain, we are to beg of him, that
we may never be destitute of what is necessary for our glorifying
him therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. This petition is to be considered as respecting others as
well as ourselves; <i>Give us</i>, &amp;c. whereby we express a concern
for their advantage in what respects the good things of this
life. The blessings of providence flow from an inexhaustible
fountain; and therefore we are not to think that, by desiring
that others may have a supply of their wants, there will not be
enough remaining for us.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this should always teach us to bear our part in relieving
others, that they may not, through our neglect, perish for want
of the necessaries of this life: Thus we are exhorted <i>to deal
our bread to the hungry</i>, to <i>bring the poor that are cast out to</i>
our <i>houses, and when we see the naked, to cover them, and not
to hide</i> ourselves <i>from</i> our <i>own flesh</i>, Isa. lviii. 7. And Job
having been severely accused by his friends, as though all
those afflictions that befel him, were in judgment for his
having oppressed and <i>forsaken the poor</i>, and <i>violently taken
away an house which he builded not</i>, as Zophar insinuates,
Job xx. 19. vindicates himself from the charge in the strongest
terms, when he says, <i>I have not withheld the poor from their
desire, nor caused the eyes of the widow to fail; nor eaten my
morsel myself alone</i>, so that <i>the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
nor seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without
covering</i>, chap. xxxi. 16-19. This is not only to pray,
that God would give others their daily bread; but to help them,
so far as it is in our power, which is very agreeable to what
we pray for in their behalf, as well as our own, when we say,
as in this petition, <i>Give us this day our daily bread</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus concerning the matter of this petition, as explained in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>this answer; of which we shall give a summary account in the
following meditation, which may be of use for the reducing our
Saviour’s direction into practice: Accordingly we address him
in this manner, “Our eyes wait on thee, O thou preserver of
men, who givest to all their meat in due season. We are
poor, indigent creatures, whose necessities oblige us to request
a daily supply, for our outward as well as spiritual
wants. Thou hast granted us life and favour; and, having
obtained help from thee, we continue unto this day. Thou
preparest a table for us; our cup runneth over; we have
never been wholly destitute of those outward blessings which
tend to make our pilgrimage, through this world, easy and
comfortable: We therefore adore thee for the care and goodness
of thy providence, which continues to us forfeited
blessings. We have, by our sins, deserved to be deprived
of all the good things we enjoy, which we have not used to
thy glory, as we ought to have done. We acknowledge ourselves
less than the least of all thy mercies; yet thou hast
encouraged us to pray and hope for the continuance thereof:
We leave it to thine infinite wisdom, to chuse that condition
of life which thou seest best for us. It is not the great
things of this world that we are solicitous about, but that
portion thereof which is necessary to our glorifying thee
therein. Thou hast made it our duty, and accordingly we
desire, to use that industry which is necessary to attain a
comfortable subsistence in the world; yet we are sensible
that the success thereof is wholly owing to thy blessing: We
therefore beg, that thou wouldst prosper our undertaking;
since it is thy blessing alone that maketh rich, and addeth
no sorrow therewith. Keep our desires after the world within
their due bounds; and enable us to be content with what
thou art pleased to allot for us, that our hearts may not be
turned aside thereby, from an earnest pursuit after that bread
which perisheth not, but endureth to everlasting life. If thou
art pleased to give us the riches of this world, let not our
hearts be set upon them; and if thou hast ordained that we
should be in low circumstances therein, may the frame of our
spirits be suited thereunto, and this condition of life be sanctified,
that it may appear, that we are not too low to be the
objects of thy special regard and discriminating grace; that
having nothing, we may really possess all things, in having
an interest in thy love. As to what concerns our future
condition in this world, though thou hast made it our duty
to use a provident care that we may not be reduced to those
straits that would render the last stage of life uncomfortable;
yet we would do this with a constant sense of the uncertainty
of life, since our times are in thy hand, our circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>in the world at thy disposal, and we rejoice that they
are so: Therefore we earnestly beg, that if it be thy sovereign
will to call us soon out of it, that we may be as well
pleased to leave, as ever we were to enjoy it, as being blessed
with a well-grounded hope of a better life: And, if it be consistent
with thy will, that our lives be prolonged in the
world, <i>Give us day by day our daily bread</i>, that we may, at
all times, experience, that thou dost abundantly bless our provision,
and satisfy us with those things which thou seest
needful for us, till we come to our journey’s end, and are
possessed of that perfect blessedness which thou hast reserved
for thy saints in a better world.”</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CXCIV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXCIV.</span> <i>What do we pray for the fifth petition?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> In the fifth petition, [which is, <i>Forgive us our debts as
we forgive our debtors</i>] acknowledging that we, and all
others, are guilty both of original and actual sin, and thereby
become debtors to the justice of God; and that neither
we, nor any other creature, can make the least satisfaction
for that debt. We pray for ourselves and others, that God
of his free grace would, through the obedience and satisfaction
of Christ apprehended and applied by faith, acquit us
both from the guilt and punishment of sin, accept us in his
Beloved, continue his favour and grace to us, pardon our
daily failings, and fill us with peace and joy, in giving us
daily more and more assurance of forgiveness, which we are
the rather emboldened to ask, and encouraged to expect
when we have this testimony in ourselves, that we, from the
heart, forgive others their offences.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having been directed, in the former petition, to pray for
outward blessings; we are now led to ask for forgiveness
of sin; and it is with very good reason that these two petitions
are joined together, inasmuch as we cannot expect that
God should give us the good things of this life, which are all
forfeited by us, much less, that we should have them bestowed
on us in mercy, and for our good, unless he is pleased to forgive
those sins, whereby we provoke him to withhold them
from us: Neither can we take comfort in any outward blessings,
while our consciences are burdened with a sense of the
guilt of sin, and we have nothing to expect, as the consequence
thereof, but to be separated from his presence; therefore we
are taught to pray, that God would <i>forgive us our sins</i>, as one
evangelist expresses it, or our <i>debts</i>, as it is in the other.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>From whence it may be observed, in general, that sin is a
debt. As it is contrary to the holiness of God, it is a
stain and blemish, a dishonour and reproach to us; as it is
a violation of his law it is a crime; and, as to what respects
the guilt which we contract hereby, it is called <i>a debt</i>; which
is the principal thing considered in this petition. There was a
debt of obedience demanded from us as creatures: and, in
case of the failure hereof, or any other sin committed by us,
there was a threatening denounced, pursuant to the sanction of
the law, from whence arises a debt of punishment; and in
this respect it is that we are directed, more especially, in this
petition, to pray for forgiveness. There are several things
which respect the nature of forgiveness, as founded on the satisfaction
given by Christ, as our Surety: which have been
largely insisted on under some foregoing answers<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c012'><sup>[121]</sup></a>: Therefore,
the method we shall observe, in considering the subject-matter
of this petition, shall be,</p>

<p class='c006'>I. To take a view of sinful man as charged with guilt, and
rendered uneasy under a sense thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. How he is to address himself to God by faith and prayer
for forgiveness. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>III. The encouragement which he has to hope that his prayer
will be answered. Under which head we shall take occasion
to consider how far that disposition which we have to forgive
others, is an evidence hereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. Concerning the charge of guilt upon us, and that uneasiness
which is the consequence thereof. Here we consider the
sinner as apprehended and standing before God, the Judge of
all; an accusation brought in against him, in which he is
charged with apostacy and rebellion against his rightful Lord
and Sovereign, and, as the consequence thereof, his nature is
vitiated and depraved, his heart deceitful above all things, and
desperately wicked; from whence proceed all actual transgressions,
with their respective aggravations, which, according
to the tenor of the law of God, deserve his wrath and curse,
both in this life, and that which is to come<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c012'><sup>[122]</sup></a>. And this charge
is made good against him by such convincing evidence, that he
must be very much unacquainted with himself, and a stranger to
the law of God, if he does not see it: But if we suppose him stupid,
and persisting in his own vindication, through the blindness
of his mind, and hardness of his heart, and ready to say
with Ephraim, <i>In all my labours they shall find none iniquity in
me, that were sin</i>, Hos. xii. 8. yet the charge will, notwithstanding,
appear to be just, and every mouth shall be stopped,
and they are forced to confess themselves guilty before God:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>Upon this, conscience is awakened, and trembles at the thoughts
of falling into the hands of an absolute God, who appears no
otherwise to him than as a consuming fire; his terrors set
themselves in array against him, and this cannot but fill him
with the greatest anguish, especially because there is no method
which he can find out, to free himself from that misery, which
he dreads as the consequence thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>If he pretends to extenuate his crimes, it will not avail him;
and if his own conscience does not come in as a witness
against him, as having been a party concerned in the rebellion,
it is an argument that it is rendered stupid by a continuance
therein: Nothing that it can allege in its own vindication, will
be regarded in the court of heaven, but rather tend to add
weight to the guilt he has contracted; for the omniscience of
God will bring an unanswerable charge against him, as being
a transgressor of his law, and thereby liable to condemnation,
upon which, vindictive justice will demand satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>If he makes an overture to pay the debt, he must either
yield sinless obedience, which is impossible, from the nature
of the thing; or bear the stroke of justice, and suffer the punishment
that is due to him, which, if he is content to do, he
knows not what it is to fall into the hands of the living God, or
to be plunged into an abyss of endless misery. If he thinks
that he shall be secure by flying from justice, this would be a
vain attempt, since God is omnipresent; and <i>there is no darkness
or shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may
hide themselves</i>, Job xxxiv. 52.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nothing therefore remains, but that he make supplication
to his Judge, that he would pass by the crimes he has committed,
without demanding satisfaction: But this is to desire,
that he would act contrary to the holiness of his nature; which
would be such a blemish on his perfections, that he is obliged
to reject: What is this but to relinquish his throne, deny his
sovereignty, and act contrary to his own law, which is the rule
of his government, whereby sinners will take occasion to transgress,
expecting that they may do this with impunity?</p>

<p class='c006'>But, is there no intercessor that will plead his cause, or appear
for him in the court of heaven? this cannot be done but
by one who is able to make an atonement, and thereby secure
the glory of divine justice, by having the debt transferred or
placed to his account, and giving a full satisfaction for it; but
this belongs to none but our Lord Jesus Christ, who has obtained
redemption and forgiveness through his blood; and
none can take encouragement from hence, but he that addresses
himself to God by faith, which we are now considering
the sinner as destitute of, and therefore the charge of guilt
remains upon him. And it is certain, that the consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>hereof is such, as will tend to fill him with the greatest uneasiness
under the burthen that lies on his conscience, which has
a perpetual dread of the execution of the sentence that is in
force against him. This wounds his spirits; and it is impossible
for any one to apply healing medicines, but by directing
him according to the prescription contained in the gospel, to
seek forgiveness in that way in which God applies it, in and
through a Mediator.</p>

<p class='c006'>II. We are now to consider, how a person is to address
himself to God by faith and prayer for forgiveness, which is
the principal thing designed in this petition. Here it is to be
acknowledged, that when we draw nigh to God, it is with a
sense of guilt, and, it may be, with great distress of conscience,
arising from it; yet it differs very much from what was observed
under the last head, when we considered a sinner as
standing before an absolute God, without any hope of obtaining
forgiveness, since that cannot but fill him with dread and
horror; whereas, this is an expedient for his obtaining a settled
peace of conscience; and, indeed, there is nothing of greater
importance, than our performing this duty in a right manner.
And, in order thereunto, let it be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That when we pray for forgiveness of sin it is supposed,
that none can bestow this blessing upon us but God. No one
has a right to forgive an offence, but he against whom it is committed:
This will appear, if we consider sin as a neglect or refusal
to pay a debt of obedience, which is due from us, to
God, and consequently it would be an invading his right, for
any one who had no power to demand it, to pretend to give a
discharge to the sinner as an insolvent debtor: This would be
to act like the person mentioned in the parable, who was appointed
indeed, to receive his lord’s debts, but not to cancel
them; and therefore, our Saviour calls him an <i>unjust steward</i>;
and he is said to have <i>wasted his lord’s goods</i>, by compounding
the debts which were owing to him without his order,
Luke xvi. 1. <i>&amp; seq.</i> Now, since obedience, as it is a religious
duty is due to God alone; it is only he that can give a
discharge to those who have not performed it: and since it belongs
to him as a judge and law-giver, to punish offenders, it
would be the highest affront to him for a creature to pretend
to this prerogative; and therefore God appropriates it to himself,
when he says, <i>I even I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions
for mine own sake</i>, Isa. xliii. 25. which expression is
to be understood of him exclusive of all others; accordingly,
when the Jews charge our Saviour with blasphemy on his forgiving
sins, and say, <i>Who can forgive sins but God only?</i> the
proposition was true, how false soever the inference, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>they deduce from thence to disprove his Deity, might be. We
shall now consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. That all ought to pray for forgiveness, and in what sense
this is to be done,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) All ought to pray for forgiveness: One would think,
that this is so evident, and agreeable to the condition of fallen
man, as well as founded on many scriptures, and expressly
commanded in this petition, which we are explaining, that it is
needless to give a farther proof of it; but this we are obliged
to do, inasmuch as some have asserted that a justified person
ought not to pray for pardon of sin, since this is what is already
done: This is an inference from what they advance, who
plead for actual justification from eternity; and therefore it is,
as they suppose, equally absurd for such an one to pray, that
God would forgive him, as it is to pray that he would choose
them to eternal life, or that Christ would satisfy divine justice
for the sins of his people, which he has already done. It is, indeed,
not very easy to understand what some persons mean,
when they insist on this subject, inasmuch as they lay down
propositions, without sufficiently explaining them; and whatever
they allege in their vindication, that they intend nothing
else hereby but what is agreeable to the sentiments of the reformed
churches, it is certain, that they advance several
things, or, at least, make use of such unguarded expressions as
are altogether disowned by them; and, at the same time, give
occasion to some, to run into the contrary extreme, who, for
fear of being thought to assert eternal justification, deny the
eternal purpose of God relating thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>But whatever they intend when they say, that a justified
person ought not to pray for pardon of sin; the contrary to
this is sufficiently evident from scripture. For every believer
is a justified person; therefore, if we have any instance of believers
praying for the pardon of sin, this sufficiently confutes
that absurd notion which we are opposing. Now that many
have prayed for pardon of sin, who have, at the same time,
been true believers, is evident, from David’s praying for the
pardon of sin, as he often does: Thus he says, in Psal. xxv.
11. <i>For thy name’s sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity, for it is
great</i>; and yet, at the same time, he expresses himself like a
justified person; <i>O my God, I trust in thee</i>, ver. 2. and ver. 5.
<i>Thou art the God of my salvation</i>: And, in Psal. cxliii. 2. he
prays, <i>Enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified</i>; yet, at the same time, he appears
to be a believer; for he speaks, in ver. 8. of his <i>trusting
in</i>, and <i>lifting up his soul to God</i>, and <i>fleeing to him</i>, that he
would <i>hide him</i>, ver. 9. which are all acts of justifying faith;
and, in Psal. li. 1. he prays, <i>Have mercy upon me, O God, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>to thy loving-kindness; according to the multitude of
thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions</i>; and, in ver. 9.
<i>Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities</i>:
Whereas he had an intimation before from God, that he had
pardoned his sin, 2 Sam. xii. 13. which, as appears by the preface
to this Psalm, was the occasion of its composure; so that
the Spirit of God hereby put words into his mouth, and taught
him, notwithstanding the assurance he had from him of his
having obtained forgiveness, to pray for it: And the apostle
Paul was in a justified state, when he expressed his earnest desire
of being <i>found in Christ, not having his own righteousness,
but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness
which is of God by faith</i>, Phil. iii. 9. This might also be argued
from all those scriptures, that represent believers as praying
for salvation, which cannot be done without praying for
forgiveness of sin, as being inseparably connected therewith. I
shall therefore add no more concerning the obligation which
all are under, to pray for the pardon of sin, but proceed to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) In what sense we are to pray for it. This may, without
much difficulty, be determined, if we rightly state the doctrine
of justification, which, if it be considered as an immanent
act in God, or the eternal purpose of his will, not to impute
sin, which is what divines call decretive justification, it is to be
allowed, that this is no more to be prayed for than eternal
election; neither are we to pray, that Christ may be constituted
the Head and Surety of his elect, or, that he might finish
transgressions, make an end of sin, and bring in an everlasting
righteousness, for that is already done. But, inasmuch as the
scripture often speaks of justification as consisting in the application
of Christ’s righteousness, or that right we have to lay claim
to it, which is styled justification by faith, and is the only foundation
on which we build our hope, that we have an interest in
what Christ did and suffered, and are thereby discharged from
guilt and condemnation. This cannot be before we believe;
and in this sense we pray that God would justify us: Now
since forgiveness of sin is a branch of justification, it is, in this
sense that we pray for the pardon of sin. And this includes
in it,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] An earnest desire that God would not lay those sins to
our charge that we daily commit; or, that he would not, as the
Psalmist says, <i>enter into judgment</i> with us, Psal. cxliii. 2. And,
as the consequence hereof, we pray, that God would not punish
us as our iniquities deserve. This is to pray for the application
of Christ’s righteousness as the ground and foundation
of our claim to forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>[2.] We are to pray for the comfortable fruits and effects of
forgiveness, that <i>being justified by faith, we may have peace
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ</i>, and <i>access by faith,
into this grace wherein we stand</i>, Rom. v. 1, 2. or, that we may
be able to conclude, that our persons and services are accepted
in the Beloved; and that Christ hath loved us, and washed
us from our sins in his own blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] We are to pray for the assurance or comfortable sense
hereof, that hereby we may rejoice in hope of the glory of
God: And, inasmuch as we daily contract guilt, we are to
pray that this blessing may be daily applied to us, and that,
both living and dying, we may be dealt with as those who are
interested in Christ’s righteousness as our Surety and Redeemer.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be objected, that pardon of sin is a blessing that every
believer has; and therefore he ought not to pray for it. To
this I answer, that there are many privileges which God does,
or will certainly bestow upon his people, which they are, nevertheless,
to pray for; otherwise they, who are in a state of
grace, are not to pray for perseverance in grace; because they
are assured that it shall be maintained unto salvation, according
to God’s promise: And, indeed, whatever promises are
contained in the covenant of grace, a believer ought not, according
to this method of reasoning, to pray that God would
apply them to him, and so glorify his faithfulness in accomplishing
them, since he is certainly persuaded that he will do
it; whereas, all allow that we are to pray for this privilege:
Therefore, if we have a full assurance that God has forgiven
our sins; yet, inasmuch as we daily contract guilt, we are
daily to pray, that he would not lay it to our charge, or deal
with us as our iniquities deserve.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We shall now consider, how we are to address ourselves
to God, or what views we are to have of him when we pray
for forgiveness of sin. This depends on the idea we have of
those perfections which he glorifies in bestowing this privilege;
and these are, more especially, his mercy, grace and faithfulness,
in accomplishing what he has promised in the covenant of
grace. As for his justice, that is considered, as will be observed
under a following head, as having received a full satisfaction;
but this is concerned in the purchase, not in the application
of forgiveness; and therefore, though God, in this
respect, appears with the glory of a Judge, resolving to make
no abatements of the debt which was contracted, that he may
thereby express his utmost detestation of the sins committed:
in this sense forgiveness is not to be obtained by entreaty; for
it is inconsistent with the character of a Judge, to be moved
thereby, and contrary to the demands of law and justice. But,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>on the other hand, when we draw nigh to him, we consider
him as a Father who delights in mercy, as it is particularly intimated
in the preface to this prayer; and therefore we do not
come before him as summoned to stand at his tribunal, and to
be weighed in the balance by him, in which respect we would
be found wanting, and, if our iniquities should be marked by
him, could not stand; but we consider ourselves as invited to
come into his presence, in hope of obtaining this privilege; and
we consider him as he has revealed himself in the gospel, in
which we are told, that there is forgiveness with him, that he
may be feared, not as the criminal fears his judge, who is
ready to pass sentence upon him; but as a child comes into
his father’s presence with such a fear as proceeds from love,
and is the result of that encouragement which is given him,
that he should be accepted in his sight: And, the great inducement
hereunto, is the intimation that he has given thereof in
the promises of the covenant of grace, and particularly those
that respect forgiveness, in which he has discovered himself as
a God ready to pardon, <i>gracious and merciful, slow to anger,
and of great kindness</i>, Neh. ix. 17. with whom is <i>plenteous redemption</i>,
Psal. cxxx. 7. he also styles himself, <i>Our God, who
will abundantly pardon</i>, inasmuch as <i>his thoughts and ways are
above ours, as the heavens are higher than the earth</i>, Isa. lv.
7-9. and he has likewise promised that he will <i>cast all the
sins</i> of his people <i>into the depths of the sea</i>: Therefore they
consider him not only as glorifying his mercy, but as <i>performing
his truth</i>, and acting agreeably to his faithfulness, Micah
vii. 19, 20. and, all this depends entirely on the discoveries he
has made of himself to us through a Mediator: This leads us
to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The way in which God bestows this blessing, and we are
to seek it at his hand by faith and prayer. We have before
observed, that it would be an affront to the divine Majesty, to
suppose that he will extend mercy to guilty sinners, without securing
the glory of his vindictive justice; and this depends
wholly on the satisfaction that Christ has given to it: Therefore
we are to beg forgiveness for his sake, whom God has set
forth to be a propitiation for his sake, that he might be just,
and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus; we are therefore
first considered as having his righteousness imputed to
us, and then this blessing, which we pray for, is applied to us.
In this method of praying for forgiveness, we take occasion to
adore the wisdom of God, which has found out this expedient
to hallow or sanctify his own name, as well as secure to us an
interest in his love, and, at the same time, we express the high
esteem we have for the person of Christ, who has procured it
for us, as also the infinite value of the price he paid in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>thereunto; and we refer our cause to him, that, as our Advocate,
he would appear on our behalf, in the merit of his obedience
and sufferings; that our petition may be granted in such
a way, that God hereby may have the highest revenue of glory
redounding to himself, and we receive the blessings consequent
thereupon.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. We are now to consider the frame of spirit with which
we are to pray for forgiveness. There is no grace but what is
to be exercised in prayer, agreeably to the subject-matter
thereof; and it is evident, from the nature of the thing, that
when we pray for forgiveness, it ought to be with a penitent
frame of spirit: Accordingly repentance and forgiveness of
sins are often connected in scripture. Thus it is said, <i>Repent
and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out</i>, Acts iii. 19.
not that we are to suppose that repentance, or any other grace,
is the cause of God’s secret purpose or determination to forgive
sin, or, that he accepts of it as any part of that atonement
or satisfaction which his justice requires to be made for it; for
this is to ascribe that to it which belongs entirely to Christ’s
righteousness; yet repentance is so far necessary to forgiveness,
that it would be a very preposterous thing for any one to
ask this favour either of God or man without it. Not to repent
of a crime committed, is, in effect, a pleading for it, and
a tacit resolution to persist in it, which disqualifies us from
pleading a pardon; and it would be contrary to the divine perfections
for God to give it to those who hereby do, as it were,
practically disown their need of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the necessity of repentance, in those who are praying
and hoping for forgiveness, appears from the connexion that
there is between it, and all other graces; which, though distinguished,
are not separated from it, and they are, all of them,
necessary to salvation, which we can, by no means attain to,
without being forgiven.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. We proceed to consider, the encouragement that they,
who plead for forgiveness with the exercise of faith, repentance
and other graces, have to expect, that they shall be heard
and answered; and more particularly, how far that disposition,
which we have to forgive others is an evidence
thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Grace exercised, is an evidence of forgiveness. This appears,
in that it is a work and fruit of the Spirit, a branch of
sanctification, and an earnest of eternal life; and, in this respect,
that good work may be truly said to be begun, which
God will certainly carry on, and perfect in glory: of this, I
say, every grace, provided it be true and genuine, is an evidence,
from whence we may conclude our right to forgiveness,
or justification, which is inseparably connected with it; as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>apostle says, <i>Whom he called, them he justified; and whom he
justified, them he also glorified</i>, Rom. viii. 30.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are now to consider how far, or in what respect, our
exercising forgiveness towards others, is an evidence of our
having obtained forgiveness from God, which is the sense given
in those words, <i>as we forgive our debtors</i>. We may here observe
the variation of the expression in Matthew and Luke;
in the former it is said, <i>Forgive us our debts as we forgive our
debtors</i>; and, in the latter, <i>Forgive us our sins; for we also
forgive every one that is indebted to us</i>. There is a little difficulty
contained in the sense of the particles, <span class='fss'>AS</span> and <span class='fss'>FOR</span>,
which must be so explained, that the sense of the petition, in
both evangelists may appear to be the same: Therefore,
when Matthew says, <i>Forgive us our debts as we forgive our
debtors</i>, the particle <span class='fss'>AS</span>, is not a note of equality, but of similitude;
and accordingly it signifies, that we are to forgive
others, even as God, for Christ’s sake, has forgiven us; or, as
we hope to obtain forgiveness from him; though, if we compare
these two together, there is an infinite disproportion between
them, as to the injuries forgiven, and other circumstances
that attend the action. The injuries that are done to
us are very small, if compared with the crimes that we commit
against God; and when we are said to forgive them, there is
no comparison between it and that forgiveness which we desire
from the hand of God. God’s forgiving us is, indeed, a motive
to us to forgive others, but one is not the measure, or
standard of the other: It therefore implies, that while we ask
for forgiveness, we ought to do it with a becoming frame of
spirit, as those who are inclined to forgive others, and, at the
same time to bless God, that he has wrought this disposition in
us; and, so far as we make use of it, as an argument in prayer,
the meaning thereof is, that since he has made it our duty,
and we trust, has also given us this grace to forgive others;
we hope, that he will, in like manner, <i>forgive us our trespasses</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are now to consider the petition as laid down by the
evangelist Luke; <i>Forgive us our sins; for we also forgive
every one that is indebted to us</i>: which is, for substance, the
same with that in Matthew, as but now explained: Accordingly
the particle <span class='fss'>FOR</span>, is not causal, but demonstrative; and
therefore we are not to understand it as though our forgiving
others were the ground and reason of God’s forgiving us, since
that would be to put it in the room of Christ’s righteousness;
but the meaning is, that we are encouraged to hope that he
will forgive us, from this demonstrative evidence; since he has
given us that grace which inclines and disposes us to forgive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>others; from whence we have ground to conclude, that we
shall obtain the blessing we pray for.</p>

<p class='c006'>This leads us to consider the nature and extent of forgiveness,
as exercised by us, and our obligation to perform this
duty; and when this may be said to be an evidence of our obtaining
forgiveness from God.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>First</i>, Concerning the nature and extent of forgiveness, as
exercised by us; for the understanding of which, let it be premised,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] That the injuries that are done us, are to be considered
either as they contain an invasion upon, or denying us those
rights which belong to us, agreeably to that station and condition
in life, in which the providence of God has fixed us:
these must be reckoned injuries, because they are detrimental
to us, and acts of injustice; or, they may be farther considered,
as crimes committed against God, inasmuch as they infer a violation
of the law of nature, which is instamped with his authority;
whereby the rights of every particular person are determined,
and to deprive us of them, is a sin against God, in
the same sense in which sins immediately committed against
men, are said to be committed against him. And by this we
may be farther led to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] That injuries are only to be forgiven by us, as they are
against ourselves; whereas God alone can forgive them as
they are against him; and the reason hereof is, because no one
can dispense with that punishment which is due for the violation
of a law, but the supreme authority. The precept that is to be
obeyed, and the sanction that binds over the offender to suffer
for his violation of it, must be established by the highest authority.
And therefore, inasmuch as the creature cannot demand
that obedience which is due to God alone; for the same reason
he cannot remit that debt of punishment which belongs only to
God to inflict. However, we are to desire, that God would
pardon, rather than punish those that have injured us: And
this is the only sense in which we may be said to forgive
others those crimes that are committed against God, if this
may be called forgiveness. But, so far as any injury respects
ourselves, as being detrimental to us, it is our duty to forgive
it, and not to exercise that private revenge which is inconsistent
with the subject-matter of this petition.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] So far as an injury, which more especially respects ourselves,
contains in it a violation of human laws, whereby the
offender has rendered himself obnoxious to a capital punishment;
it does not belong to us, as private persons, to forgive
the criminal, so as to obstruct the course of justice, since this
is a matter that does not concern us, as not having the executive
part of human laws in our power; and to pretend to this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>would be not only to violate the laws of men, but to commit an
offence against God, who has established the just rights of civil
government; therefore, that forgiveness which we are obliged
to exercise towards others, does not extend itself to this matter.
Nor are we obliged, when we forgive those that have injured
us, to be unconcerned about doing justice to ourselves,
when it is possible, or at least easy, for us to have redress in
the course of law or equity; especially if the damage we sustain
hereby, be, in a very great degree, prejudicial to ourselves
or families. And if it affects our good name in the world, the
forgiving those reproaches that are cast upon us, is not inconsistent
with our using endeavours to vindicate our own reputation;
though it may be, this can hardly be done without exposing
him that has done us the injury, to suffer that shame
which he brought on himself thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>These things being premised, we proceed to consider, the nature
and extent of forgiveness, as it is to be exercised by us,
so far as the injury committed respects ourselves. This is opposed
to our bearing the least degree of malice against the offender,
or carrying our resentments too far, by magnifying
lesser injuries, and meditating revenge: Nor ought we to be
so partial in our own cause, as to deny, or altogether overlook
those things that are, in other respects commendable in him,
as though a crime committed against us, were altogether inconsistent
with the least degree of virtue or goodness in him
that has committed it. If he has done injustice to us, this
does not excuse any act of injustice to his person or character
in other instances, which have not an immediate relation to
ourselves; which is to see things through a false medium, or
to infer consequences that cannot fairly be deduced from any
thing that he has done, how injurious soever it may have been
to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we are not to take occasion from the ill treatment
we have met with, from any one, to endeavour to ruin him, as
to his estate or character in the world; since that is not a proper
expedient, either to do justice to ourselves, or bring him,
who has done us the injury to repentance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we may take occasion to enquire, how far a person that
is injured by another, may demand satisfaction? and, whether
it is our duty to forgive him, though it be neither in his power
nor inclination to make it?</p>

<p class='c006'>The answer that I would give to this, is; that the law of God
and nature, does not prohibit us from demanding satisfaction
in proportion to the injury received; since this is a debt we
ought to claim, in justice to ourselves, and our character in the
world: Nevertheless, it must be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span><i>1st</i>, That it may sometimes be out of his power to make full
satisfaction; in which case we must be content, and forgive
the injury without it; and we are to deal with him in like
manner, as we are obliged to do with those who are insolvent
in pecuniary debts. But,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, We suppose, that the person who has injured us, is
able in some measure, to make satisfaction; but he is so far
from being willing to do it, that he refuses to acknowledge his
crime, and, which is still worse, seems inclined, as occasion
may offer, to commit it again, which is the worst of tempers,
especially if the injury be not barely supposed, but real: Yet
this is no rule for us to proceed by, in forgiving injuries; for
the understanding of which let it be considered, that satisfaction
for injuries committed, consists either in making a compensation
in proportion to the damage sustained thereby, or
else in a bare acknowledgment of the fault committed. The
former of these we may, in justice, insist on; but yet, in most
cases, where the injury only respects ourselves, it may be dispensed
with, or demanded at pleasure; but whether it be given
or no, it is so far our duty to pass it by, as not to bear the least
degree of malice against him, that has injured us, though he refuses
to give it. As to the latter, where no more is demanded,
than a bare acknowledgment of the offence committed,
which cannot be supposed to be out of the power of the offender
to do; but he is resolved that he will not make this
small satisfaction, as persisting in his own vindication, and determines
to do the same again, as occasion offers: we are to let
him know, that herein he not only sins against us, but God,
and to exhort him to confess his crime before him; and therefore
we pity his obstinacy, while we express our readiness to
pass by the injury he has done us: However, such an one is
not to be chosen by us as an intimate friend or associate, out
of a principle of self-preservation, that he may not be in a capacity
of doing us the same injuries for the future, which his obstinacy
discovers him to be inclined to do. Thus concerning
the nature and extent of this duty of forgiving injuries: We
proceed to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Secondly</i>, The indispensable obligation we are under to perform
it; otherwise we could not make this appeal to God in
prayer, or take encouragement to hope, that we shall obtain
forgiveness from him. To induce us hereunto, let us consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That if God should deal with us as we do with our fellow-creatures,
when we refuse to forgive them, we should be
for ever miserable. This our Saviour illustrates by the parable
of the debtor and creditor, in Matt. xviii. 24, <i>&amp; seq.</i> where
a person is represented as <i>owing ten thousand talents</i>, and <i>his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>lord</i>, upon his entreaty, <i>forgave him the debt</i>; and afterwards
he dealt severely with one that owed him but an <i>hundred pence</i>,
and thereby provoked his lord to <i>deliver him to the tormentors,
till he should pay all that was due unto him</i>; which parable,
though it does not argue the least mutability in the divine purpose
relating hereunto, yet we may infer from hence, how inconsiderable
the injuries that are done us are, if compared with
those which we have done against God; and how little ground
we have to expect forgiveness from him, if we are not disposed
to forgive others.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, An implacable spirit, meditating revenge for injuries
done against us, will render us altogether unfit for the performance
of an holy duty, and particularly this of imploring
forgiveness from God: It also exposes us to many temptations;
accordingly the apostle speaks of anger retained in our breasts,
or <i>letting the sun go down upon our wrath</i>, as that which <i>gives
place to the Devil</i>, Eph. iv. 26, 27.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Malice and fury tend to exasperate an enemy; whereas,
forgiveness melts him into friendship, and very much recommends
the gospel, which obliges us to shew such instances
of brotherly kindness, even where they are least deserved.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, We have many bright examples for our imitation, of
the best of men, who have been highly injured, and yet have
expressed a forgiving spirit. Thus Joseph forgave the injuries
done against him by his brethren, when, after his father’s
death, they were jealous that he would hate them, and requite
them all the evil that they had done unto him; but he not only
comforted and spake kindly to them, but made very liberal
provision for the subsisting of them and their families, Gen. 1.
15-21. And, Moses, when Miriam was smitten with leprosy,
for speaking against him, prays for her recovery, Numb.
xii. 13. And, when the Syrian host was sent on purpose to
destroy the prophet Elisha, and God had delivered them into
his hand, being in the midst of Samaria, and the king of Israel
was ready to smite them, had he desired it; but this he was
so far from doing, that he says, <i>Thou shalt not smite them:
Wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with
thy sword, and with thy bow, set bread and water before them,
that they may eat and drink and go to their master</i>, 2 Kings
vi. 22.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, in the New Testament, we have an instance of a forgiving
spirit in Stephen, when, in the very agonies of death,
having been before insulted, and now stoned by his enraged
enemies; it is said, <i>He kneeled down, and cried with a loud
voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge</i>, Acts vii. 60. But
the highest instance that can be given of the exercise of this
grace we have in our Saviour, who prayed for them that crucified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>him; <i>Father forgive them for they know not what they
do</i>, Luke xxiii. 34. These examples are worthy of our imitation;
and therefore we should reckon ourselves obliged to forgive
those who have injured us.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Object.</i> It will be objected by some, that the injuries done
them, are so very great, that they are not to be borne; and it
would be dishonourable for them not to take any notice thereof:
Or, it may be, the ingratitude that is expressed herein, is
such that it deserves the highest resentment; and if it should
be passed over, it might be reckoned a tacit approbation of their
crime, and give occasion to them, that have committed the injury
against them, to despise them, and do the like for the
future.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Answ.</i> To this it may be replied;</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, That if the injury be great, it will be much more commendable,
and a greater instance of virtue and grace to forgive
than to resent it; for in this a man overcomes himself,
subdues his own passions, and thereby lets his enemy know,
that he has a due sense of the divine command relating thereunto,
and that his spirit is sanctified and calmed by the power
of divine grace. This is reckoned one of the greatest victories;
as it is said, <i>He that is slow to anger is better than the
mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a
city</i>, Prov. xvi. 32.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, As for our honour, which is pretended to be concerned
herein, they who allege it, are very much mistaken in their
sentiments about true honour; since it is said, <i>The discretion
of a man deferreth his anger, and it is his glory to pass over his
transgression</i>, chap. xix. 11.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, This does not, in the least, argue, that the person who
forgives, approves of his crime, who has done him the injury,
since this is not inconsistent with our charging it on his conscience,
and endeavouring to bring him under a sense of guilt,
as having not only injured us, but done that which is highly
displeasing to God; and he may be given to understand, that
hereby he has wronged his own soul more than us, and therefore
has great reason to be humbled before God, and repent of
his sin committed against us, which, as it is committed against
God, he only can forgive; though we let him know, that we
are disposed to forgive him, so far as the crime is directed
against us.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, As to the pretence, that forgiving injuries will make
those who have done them grow bold, and be more hardened
in their crimes; and that they will hereby take occasion to insult,
and do the like injuries for the future: It may be replied,
that this very seldom happens; but if it should, we must
consider that the ungrateful abuse of a kind and generous action,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>or the possibility of this consequence ensuing thereupon,
is no sufficient excuse for our not performing it. But if there
be the least ingenuity of temper, or if it pleases God, by his
grace, to succeed our kind behaviour toward them for their
good, it will have a far different effect; as it is observed, <i>A soft
answer turneth away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger</i>,
Prov. chap. xv. 1. Thus concerning the obligation we are under to
forgive the injuries that are committed against us: We are
now to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Thirdly</i>, How this is an evidence, or may afford us ground
of hope, that we shall obtain forgiveness from God, when we
are praying for it. Here let it be observed, that forgiving
injuries, may be considered barely as a virtue, proceeding from
a goodness of temper, or the sense that persons have of the
equity and reasonableness thereof, and from other motives
which the light of nature may suggest, or, as it is recommended
by Seneca, Epictetus, and other heathen moralists:
And, indeed, it must be reckoned a very commendable quality,
and a convincing evidence that a person is, in a great degree,
master of his own passions; but we cannot from hence
conclude, that such an one is in a state of grace; and nothing
short of that can be evidence of our right to forgiveness:
Therefore we must consider this disposition to forgive injuries,
as a Christian virtue, or as containing in it some ingredients,
that manifest it to be a grace wrought in us by the Spirit,
and a branch of sanctification, and, as such, having several
other graces connected with; and accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. When our forgiving injuries is an evidence of our having
obtained forgiveness, we must do it out of a humble sense of
the many crimes that we have committed against God; and
therefore it is joined with, and flows from the grace of repentance.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It also contains in it several acts of faith; as hereby we
do, in effect, acknowledge, that all we have is in God’s hand,
who has a right to take it away when he pleases; and if he
suffers us to be deprived of our reputation and usefulness in
the world, or our wealth and outward estate therein, by the
injurious treatment we meet with from those, who, without
cause are our enemies; we are sensible that this could not be
done without his permissive providence, which we entirely acquiesce
in. The injury or injustice we wholly lay to the
charge of those who hate us, nevertheless, in obedience to our
Saviour’s command, we desire to express our love to them, in
the most valuable instances thereof, and, at the same time, to
acknowledge and bow down to the sovereignty and justice of
God, in suffering us to be thus dealt with by men, hoping and
trusting that he will over-rule this, and all other afflictive providences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>for our good; as David says, when he speaks of
God’s suffering Shimei to curse him: <i>It may be, that the Lord
will look on mine affliction, and that the Lord will requite me
good for his cursing this day</i>, 2 Sam. xvi. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. When we forgive those that have injured us, it is, with
an earnest desire that God would give them repentance, that
thereby his name may be glorified, and his interest promoted,
whatever becomes of our name and usefulness in the world.—When
we are enabled to exercise such a frame of spirit as
this in forgiving those that have injured us, we have ground to
hope, that when we pray for forgiveness, the great God, who
is the author of all that grace which we exercise in forgiving
others, will grant us this invaluable privilege.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having explained this petition, we shall now consider it as
a directory, that so we may put up our requests to God, agreeable
thereunto: Accordingly we are to cast ourselves before
his footstool, with humble confession of sin, and imploring forgiveness
from him, to this purpose: “We adore thee, O Lord,
as a God of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. Thou hast
commanded us to keep thy precepts, and hast revealed thy
wrath from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness
of men: We acknowledge that we are, by our transgressions,
become debtors to thy justice; our iniquities are
increased over our head, and our trespasses grown up unto
the heavens; and thereby we have deserved to be banished
out of thy sight, and cast into the prison of hell, without hope
of being released from thence. We are not able to stand in
judgment, and therefore we dread the thoughts of appearing
before thine awful tribunal, as an absolute God. If thou
shouldest contend with us, we cannot answer for the least sin
that we have committed; and it would be an injury to thy
justice, and an increasing of our guilt, to expect or desire,
that thou shouldest pardon our sins without receiving satisfaction
for them, which we are sensible that we are not, nor
ever shall be able to give thee. But we bless thy name, that
thou hast sent thy well-beloved Son into the world, who gave
his life a ransom for thy people; by which means thy justice
is satisfied, thy law fulfilled, and all thy perfections infinitely
glorified: He hath finished transgression, made an end of
sin, made reconciliation for iniquity, and brought in everlasting
righteousness; which is to and upon all them that
believe. Thou hast therefore given us leave, and encouraged
us to come to thee by faith, to plead with thee for redemption
and forgiveness through his blood, according to the
riches of thy grace. In him thou art a God, pardoning the
iniquity, and passing by the transgressions of the remnant of
thine heritage: Therefore we pray for this invaluable privilege
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>as those who humbly hope and trust that we have those
graces wrought in us, which are an evidence of our having
Christ’s righteousness imputed to us, for which we bless
thee; and, in particular, that thou hast enabled us to forgive
all the injuries that are done us by our fellow creatures;
which are very small and inconsiderable, if compared with
those affronts which we daily offer to thy Majesty. We beseech
thee, grant that this, and all other graces, may more
and more abound in us, that thereby our evidences of an
interest in Christ’s righteousness may be more strong and
clear; that though we daily contract guilt by our transgressions,
we may be enabled to conclude for our comfort, that
there is no condemnation to us, and that iniquity shall not
be our ruin.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CXCV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXCV.</span> <i>What do we pray for in the sixth petition?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> In the sixth petition, [which is, <i>And lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil</i>,] acknowledging that the
most wise, righteous, and gracious God, for divers holy and
just ends, may so order things, that we may be assaulted,
foiled, and for a time, led captive by temptations, that Satan,
the world, and the flesh, are ready, powerfully to draw
us aside and ensnare us; and that we, even after the pardon
of our sins, by reason of our corruption, weakness, and want
of watchfulness, are not only subject to be tempted, and
forward to expose ourselves unto temptations; but also, of
ourselves, unable and unwilling to resist them, to recover
out of them, and to improve them, and worthy to be left
under the power of them; we pray, that God would so overrule
the world, and all in it; subdue the flesh, and restrain
Satan; order all things, bestow and bless all means of grace,
and quicken us to watchfulness in the use of them, that we,
and all his people may, by his providence, be kept from
being tempted to sin; or, if tempted, that, by his Spirit, we
may be powerfully supported and enabled to stand in the
hour of temptation, or, when fallen, raised again and recovered
out of it, and have a sanctified use and improvement
thereof; that our sanctification and salvation may be perfected,
Satan trodden under our feet, and we fully freed from
sin, temptation, and all evil for ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our Saviour having, in the foregoing petition, exhorted
us to pray for forgiveness of sins, whereby the guilt of
past crimes may be removed; in this he advises us to pray
against temptation, lest being overcome thereby, we should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>contract fresh guilt, and walk unbecoming those who hope for,
or have obtained forgiveness from God. In order to our understanding
of which it will be necessary for us to premise
something tending to explain the meaning of the word <i>Temptation</i>.
Accordingly it may be taken in a good sense: Thus God
himself is sometimes said to <i>tempt</i>, or rather, which is all one,
to <i>try</i> his people. This he does by the various dispensations
of his providence, whether prosperous or adverse. And sometimes
by his commands, when he puts us upon the performance
of difficult duties, that he might prove us, whether his fear is
before us: In this respect he is said to have tempted Abraham,
proved his faith, and discovered his readiness to obey his command
in offering Isaac; and, after he had tried his faith, he
commends him, when he says, <i>Now I know that thou lovest
God</i>, Gen. xxii. 1, 12. And sometimes he is said to tempt, or
<i>allure</i>, to what is good, Hos. ii. 14. to invite his people to do
those things which redound to his glory and their real interest;
and in this sense we may and ought to tempt others, to persuade,
and, as much as in us lies, engage their affections to the
performance of what is good: Thus the apostle advises us to
<i>consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works</i>,
Heb. x. 24.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are not to understand the word <i>temptation</i> in these
senses in this petition; but it is to be taken for our being
tempted to sin, in which respect God never tempts any one:
Thus the apostle says, <i>Let no man say, when he is tempted, I
am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil; neither
tempteth he any man</i>, James i. 13. neither ought we to tempt
one another thereunto. This being premised, we come more
immediately to explain this petition: In which we shall consider
some things which are supposed; and also the subject-matter
thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>I. There are several things supposed, when we are taught
to pray, <i>Lead us not into temptation</i>. As,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That man, in this imperfect state, is very much exposed
to temptations. The world is always ready to present its alluring
objects, which are suited to the corruption of our nature,
and therefore too easily complied with: And this is farther
promoted by Satan’s suggestions, who is daily endeavouring
to entangle us in the snare that is laid for us.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. As we are daily tempted to sin, so we are in great danger
of being overcome thereby; which arises not only from the
methods used to draw us aside from God, and the many secret
snares laid for us, that are not easily discerned, but principally
from the treachery of our own hearts, which are deceitful
above all things, and very apt to incline us to commit those
sins which bring a great deal of guilt with them. It also proceeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>sometimes from a want of watchfulness; whereby the
enemy comes upon us undiscovered, and we are overcome before
we are aware of it; the temptation offers itself, and we are
unable, but willing, to resist it. And, if fallen by it, this
tends still more to weaken us, so that we cannot recover ourselves
from the pit into which we are plunged; we also find it
very difficult, if God is pleased, at any time, to suffer us to fall
by temptations, to improve them aright to his glory and our
own good.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. It is farther supposed, that God may suffer his people,
though their sins are pardoned, and their souls sanctified, to
be tempted, and sometimes even foiled and led captive for a
time; which may give us occasion to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) In what sense he may be said to tempt, or lead his
people into temptation. This he does, though without being
the author of sin,<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c012'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>[1.] Objectively; when his providential dispensations, which,
in themselves, are holy, just, and good, offer occasions of sin;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>which, nevertheless, would not ensue hereupon, did not our
corrupt nature lay hold on them as such, and abuse them:
Thus all God’s works of providence or grace, may prove
temptations to men; as the Psalmist, speaking of the <i>prosperity
of the wicked</i>, intimates, that it raised his envy, Psal. lxxiii. 3.
and elsewhere he considers the blessings of common providence
as proving a temptation, to carnal security and indifferency
in religion, to some of whom it is said, <i>Because they have
no changes, therefore they fear not God</i>, Psal. lv. 19. and, on
the other hand, afflictive providence sometimes prove temptations
to us to murmur and entertain hard thoughts of God.—Moreover,
his threatenings are oftentimes abused, and some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>thereby tempted to think him severe and unmerciful; others
complain of his commandments as grievous, because he does
not give them those indulgencies to sin which their corrupt
natures desire. In these respects God may be said to lead into
temptation; nevertheless, we are not to pray, that he would
alter the methods of his providence, or make abatements as to
the duties which he commands us to perform; but rather, that
he would not suffer us to make a wrong use of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] God leads into temptation permissively, when he does
not restrain the tempter, which he is not obliged to do, but
suffers us to be assaulted by him, and, at the same time, denies
the aids and assistance of his grace, to prevent our compliance
therewith; so that when we pray that he would <i>not lead us into
temptation</i>, we desire that he would prevent the assault, or
fortify us against it, that, through the weakness of our grace,
or the prevalency of corruption, we may not comply with the
temptation.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We shall now consider the reason why God thus leads
his people into temptation, or suffers them to be tempted: or
what are those holy, wise, just, and gracious ends, which he
designs thereby; and,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] It cannot be expected that it should be otherwise, when
we chuse to go in the way of temptation, or indulge those
corruptions, whereby we are inclined to yield to it: In this
case, God’s judicial hand appears, as he punishes for one sin,
by suffering us to be tempted to another.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] God hereby gives us occasion to see our own weakness,
and the deceitfulness of our hearts, and the need we have of
his grace, to prevent our falling by temptation: Thus it is said,
that God <i>left Hezekiah</i>, 2 Chron. xxxii. 31. compared with
2 Kings xx. 15. when he sinned in shewing the ambassadors
of the king of Babylon the treasures that he had in his house,
in which this good king discovered too much pride; whereas
it had been better had he shewn them the bed he lay on, when
he was nigh unto death, and taken occasion from thence, to
give God the glory of his miraculous recovery which was the
reason of their being sent to compliment him upon it: In this
respect <i>God left him to try him, that he might know all that was
in his heart</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] God does this, that, when we experience the superior
force of our spiritual enemies, we may, by faith and prayer,
have recourse to his almighty power and grace. Thus when
the apostle Paul was in danger of being <i>exalted above measure</i>,
through Satan’s temptations, he says, <i>For this I besought the
Lord thrice, that it might depart from me</i>, 2 Cor. xii. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] He suffers this, that we may herein have an instance of
the imperfections of this present state, and be induced to press
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>after, and long for, that state of perfect freedom, not only from
sin, but temptation, which is reserved for us in heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] We are led into temptation, that hereby we may see
the necessity of making use of the whole armour of God, that
we may be able to stand our ground. As the soldier will not
put on his armour but when he is going to engage the enemy;
so God has ordained that our life should be a perpetual warfare,
and that we should be continually exposed to the assaults
of our spiritual enemies, that we may always be prepared for
them, having <i>the girdle of truth, the breast-plate of righteousness,
the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword
of the Spirit, which is the word of God</i>, Eph. vi. 14-17. He
also suffers this, that we may, in the end, know what it is to
conquer, and have the pleasure and satisfaction arising from
hence, and that he may have the glory of this victory.</p>

<p class='c006'>[6.] God suffers this, that he may cure our sloth, and excite
us to greater watchfulness, as those who are never wholly out
of danger: Thus the apostle says, <i>Be sober, be vigilant; because
your adversary, the Devil, as a roaring lion, walketh
about, seeking whom he may devour</i>, 1 Pet. v. 8. and our Saviour
advises his disciples, to <i>watch and pray, that they enter
not into temptation</i>, Matt. xxvi. 41.</p>

<p class='c006'>[7.] God suffers us to be tempted, that we may know the
depths of Satan, which we should otherwise be unapprized of;
and that thereby we may be more prepared to make resistance,
and, when we are enabled to overcome, may be better furnished
to direct others, who are liable to like temptations, how they
should behave themselves under them, and to encourage them
to hope that they should be delivered, as we have been.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. It is farther observed, that though God suffers his people
to be tempted, and even foiled, and led captive, yet this is only
for a time. In this the temptations of believers differ from
those of the unregenerate, who are <i>taken captive by Satan at
his will</i>, 2 Tim. ii. 26. Whereas it is said concerning the believer,
that it is only <i>for a season</i>; and that, <i>if need be, he is in
heaviness through manifold temptations</i>, 1 Tim. i. 6. This leads
us to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>II. The subject-matter of the petition, when we pray that
God would <i>not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil</i>.
The only difficulty in laying down the method in which this
is to be insisted on, arises from the indeterminateness of the
word <i>evil</i>; of which, there are various senses given by them,
that explain the Lord’s prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some understand by it, the evil one, or the Devil; and then
one part of this petition may be considered as exegetical of
the other: So that, not to be led into temptation, is the same
as, to be delivered from the assaults of Satan, the evil one, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>we may not be brought under his power, or become vassals to
him, as complying with his temptations.</p>

<p class='c006'>Others understand the word in a more large sense, as an intimation
of our desire to be delivered from evil of all kinds,
and that either from the evil of sin, or the evil of afflictions,
which are the consequence of sin. If we take it for a deliverance
from the evil of sin; this respects the guilt thereof,
and the punishment that is due to it; and then it differs little
or nothing from the subject-matter of the foregoing petition,
when we pray, that God would <i>forgive us our sins</i>; or if, on
the other hand, we take it for deliverance from the evil of sin,
as it includes in it a branch of sanctification, that is, from the
dominion and slavery of sin, then it is well connected with the
former petition; for when we pray for pardon of sin, we ought
also to pray for deliverance from the reigning power thereof.
And it is very well connected with our praying against temptation;
for it is, in effect, to desire either that we may not be
assaulted by the tempter, or that we may not be drawn aside
to sin against God thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the evil of affliction, I cannot think that this is intended
by this expression, because the opposition between it
and our deliverance from temptation, would not appear to be
so just as we must suppose it is, unless we take temptation itself
to be an affliction; and then it is the same as though we
should say, deliver us from temptation, that we may not be
afflicted therewith; which we must be supposed to be, by reason
of the danger we are in of falling thereby.</p>

<p class='c006'>By passing by these critical remarks on the sense of the
words, <i>Deliver us from evil</i>, we shall consider the subject-matter
of this petition, under two general heads, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>First</i>, We shall enquire what are the temptations which we
are exposed to.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Secondly</i>, How we are to pray that we may not be led into
them; or, if we are, how we may be delivered from the evil
consequences that will arise from our compliance with them,
which is principally implied in those words, <i>Deliver us from
evil</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>First</i>, What are those temptations which we are exposed to:
These are of various kinds, all which take their rise either
from the world, the flesh, or the Devil. Their manner of acting,
indeed, is different; yet they are very often united in their
assaults, from whence we are in perpetual danger of being
overcome, if God, by his grace, is not pleased to interpose.—And,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. We shall consider the temptations that we meet with
from the world. These are either such as arise from the solicitations
of those whom we converse with therein, who, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>a pretence of friendship, persuade us to sin: Thus we read of
some who <i>entice others to lay wait for blood</i>, and desire those
whom they would ensnare into this crime, to <i>cast in their lot
among them</i>, Prov. i. 10-14. but we are advised, not to consent
to, or be confederate with them: Or else they arise from
those things in the world which present themselves to us, and
are temptations to sin, in an objective way, being not so much
the cause as the occasion thereof; and, in many instances, the
use thereof is lawful, while the abuse alone proves hurtful to
us: This is what we shall principally confine ourselves to at
present, and shew how the good and evil things of the world,
or the various conditions in which we are, whether prosperous
or adverse, prove temptations to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) The good things of the world, or the various conditions
in which we are, whether prosperous or adverse, prove temptations
to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The good things of the world are sometimes a snare to
us, or an occasion of sin, <i>viz.</i> the riches, honours and pleasures
thereof: Thus our Saviour speaks, Matt. xiii. 22. of the <i>care
of this world</i>, that is, either to gain or increase of it; and the
apostle speaks of some who had <i>forsaken the right way, following
the way of Balaam, who loved the wages of unrighteousness</i>,
2 Pet. ii. 15. or acted contrary to his conscience for
gain; and Felix perverted justice to obtain a bribe, concerning
whom it is said, <i>He hoped that money should have been given
him of Paul, that he might loose him</i>, Acts xxiv. 16. And we
read of others that <i>will be rich</i>, that is, who immoderately pursue
the gain of the world, that hereby <i>fall into temptation, and
a snare, and many hurtful lusts</i>, 1 Tim. vi. 9. And the honours
of the world are a temptation to others; Thus our Saviour says,
<i>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another</i>, John
v. 44. And others are ensnared by the pleasures of the world,
who are stiled <i>lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God</i>, 2 Tim.
iii. 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, indeed, we often find, that the necessary duties or
enjoyments of life, such as eating, drinking, and recreation;
and the various relations we stand in to others prove a temptation
to us. Many things are so, as they are used unseasonably,
immoderately, and without a due regard to the glory of
God, which ought to be our highest end in all worldly enjoyments;
and, indeed, whatever has a tendency to draw forth
our corruption, may be said to be a temptation to us: Sometimes
the prosperous condition of others has this effect upon
us: Thus Cain, beholding Abel to have a more visible token
of the divine regard to his person and offering than he had,
hated and <i>slew him</i>, Gen. iv. 5, 9. And Joseph’s being a favourite
in his father’s house, and honoured by God, in having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>divine dreams, gave occasion to his brethren to envy him;
who first designed to slay him, and afterwards, out of malice,
sold him into Egypt. And when Joshua saw Eldad and Medad
prophesying, supposing that this belonged only to Moses;
and that it was a lessening of his honour, for them to pretend
to this privilege, he desires that they might be <i>forbid</i>; but this
was plainly a temptation; for Moses gives him a check, intimating
that he did not well in <i>envying</i> them <i>for his sake</i>,
Numb. xi. 29.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, we often find, that our own condition in the
world, when we enjoy the outward blessings of providence,
proves a temptation: Some are like the vessel that is in danger
of being overset by having too much sail, and no ballast to
keep it steady: In like manner, the abundance of this world,
without the grace of God, to sanctify and set bounds to our
affections, will oftentimes prove a snare to us. Some are hereby
tempted to covetousness, than which, nothing is more preposterous;
yet nothing more common. This seems to be supposed
in the Psalmist’s advice; <i>If riches increase, set not your
heart upon them</i>, Psal. lxii. 10. and it is an intimation, that
our desires often increase with our substance, so that the more
we have, the more we want, and are less disposed to contribute
to the necessities of others: We have an instance of this
in Nabal, whose answer to the obliging message, sent by David
to him, <i>Say ye to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both
to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that
thou hast. Give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand,
unto thy servants, and to thy son David</i>, 1 Sam. xxv. 6, 8, 11.
argued him to be of a churlish disposition, and that his prosperous
circumstances in the world were a temptation to his
corruptions, having no sense of gratitude for those favours
that he had received from him and his men, while they resided
in the wilderness, and were conversant with those that kept
his flocks there. It would have been a more plausible excuse,
had he alleged the danger that might accrue to him thereby:
or, that it was possible that Saul might hear of it, and deal with
him as he had done with Abimelech, and the other priests, at
Nob, for that small respect that he had shewed him: But this
be takes no notice of, but treats him morosely, when he says
<i>Shall I take my bread and my water, and my flesh, that I have
killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not
whence they be</i>. This manifested him to be a <i>man of Belial</i>, as
Abigail confesses, when she says, <i>Nabal is his name, and folly
is with him</i>, ver. 25.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, we sometimes find, that a prosperous condition in
the world, is a temptation to God’s people to presumption and
carnal security; as the Psalmist says, <i>In my prosperity I said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>I shall never be moved</i>, Psal. xxx. 6. and the wicked are hereby
tempted to obstinacy and disobedience; as God says by
the prophet, to the Israelites, <i>I spake unto thee in thy prosperity;
but thou saidst, I will not hear; This hath been thy manner
from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice</i>, Jer. xxii.
21. And sometimes to pride, haughtiness, and oppression;
thus the Psalmist speaks of those who were <i>not in trouble, neither
plagued like other men; therefore pride compasseth them
about as a chain, violence covereth them as a garment</i>, Psal.
lxxiii. 5, 6. We are not, indeed, to suppose, that this is the
necessary result of a prosperous state in the world, since that
temptation, which is only objective, may be fenced against:
But the pernicious tendency thereof arises from the depravity
of our nature, and its proneness to abuse the blessings of providence;
from whence some take occasion to cast off fear, and
put the evil day far from them: Therefore, when we pray,
that the world may not prove a temptation to us, we desire,
that God would keep us from using any indirect means, either
to get or increase our worldly substance, but, on the other
hand, enable us to improve it to his glory; and that our affections
may not be so much set upon it as to alienate them from
him; but that we may make it the matter of our deliberate
choice, rather to be deprived of outward blessings, than receive
them as our only portion, and, by having our hearts set
too much upon them, forfeit, and be denied an interest in, his
special and distinguishing love.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) The evil things in the world often prove a temptation
to us. By <i>evil things</i>, we mean afflictive providences, which
are inseparable from this present state; since <i>man is born unto
trouble, as the sparks fly upwards</i>, Job v. 7. These are either
personal or relative; some more immediately from God, others
from men, as instruments in his hand: Some arise from the
present experience we have of affliction, others from our expectation
or fear of future troubles: and all these sometimes
prove temptations to us, unless God is pleased to interpose in
a way of preventing grace, and make them conducive to our
spiritual advantage. Now afflictions prove temptations to us,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] When we are discontented and uneasy under the hand
of God, complaining of the burdens that he is pleased to lay
on us, as though they were insupportable, and it were impossible
for us to bear up under them; or, when we are ready to
conclude, that no affliction is like ours, and are apt to insinuate,
that God hereby deals hardly with us.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] When they disturb or disorder our thoughts, weaken
our faith, and unfit us for spiritual meditations, or attending
aright on ordinances of God; or when we are more concerned,
about our afflictions, than about sin, the cause of them.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>[3.] When we have unbelieving apprehensions concerning
the event thereof, concluding that they will certainly end in
our ruin; notwithstanding the promises, which God has made
of their working together for good, to them that love him.—This
temptation David was exposed to, when he said, <i>I shall
now perish one day by the hand of Saul</i>, 1 Sam. xxvii. 1. which
was an ungrounded fear, especially considering the promises
that God had given him, and the many experiences he had of
his being a help to him in the time of trouble.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] Afflictions are temptations to us, when we take occasion
from them to question God’s fatherly love, or to conclude, that
they are sent in wrath, and are intimations that we are cast off
by him, when we have no reason to think so from any thing
that there is in the nature of affliction itself; also when we are
hindered thereby, from applying those suitable promises which
God has made to his people, in like cases, for their comfort
and support.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now when we pray that God would <i>not lead us into temptation</i>,
as afflictive providences expose us to it, we are to pray
against them with submission to the divine will, not as though
the removal thereof were of equal importance, or as necessary
to our happiness, as the taking away the guilt or power of sin:
However, we are to pray, that afflictions may be sanctified to
us; and that corrupt nature may not take occasion from them,
to have unbecoming thoughts of God; but that we may hereby
be led nearer to him, that so they may not prove a temptation
to us, or at least, that with the temptation, he would make a
way for our escape.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Another sort of temptations proceed from the flesh,
which are the greatest and most dangerous of all. The apostle
speaks of them as though they were the only temptations, when
he says, <i>Every man is tempted when he is drawn aside of his
own lust, and enticed</i>, James i. 14. since all others might, without
much difficulty, be resisted and overcome, were there not
a corrupt disposition in our nature, which the apostle calls
<i>lust</i>, that inclines us to adhere to, and comply with them. This
consists in the irregularity and disorder of our passions; which
are not only prone to rebel against God, but to act contrary
to the dictates of our own consciences, which is the result of
our fallen state; and the temptations are oftentimes various,
according to the prevailing bias of our natural temper. A
melancholy constitution sometimes inclines us to slavish fears,
or distrust of God’s providence; or to have such black and
dismal apprehensions of our spiritual concerns, that we are led
to the very brink of despair. A choleric temper prompts us
to revenge, injustice, and oppression, and puts us upon magnifying
small offences, and expressing a furious resentment without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>ground. A sanguine and airy constitution often proves a
temptation to cast off all serious thoughts about God and another
world, and to count religion a needless, melancholy and
distasteful thing, and to make a jest of what is sacred, and
ought to be treated with the utmost reverence; and this temper
frequently exposes persons to the pernicious influence of bad
company, and induces them to be lovers of pleasure more than
lovers of God. Again, a stupid, phlegmatic and heavy constitution,
often proves a temptation to negligence in our civil and
religious affairs, and not to make provision for a time of trial:
Hereby persons are often tempted to neglect holy duties, especially
such as are difficult; or to perform them in a careless
manner, and so rest in a form of godliness, without the power
thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>This difference of natural tempers is the reason why we
behold lust appearing in different shapes; so that the same
temptation that presents itself from without, suits the natural
disposition of one who eagerly embraces it, while another is
not greatly moved by it. This is what we understand by those
temptations which arise from the flesh; and, when we pray
against them, it is not to be supposed, that we expect to be
perfectly freed from them in this world, in which, as has been
elsewhere observed<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c012'><sup>[124]</sup></a>, there are the remnants of sin abiding in
every part, even in them that are sanctified, and the perpetual
lustings of the flesh against the spirit. Therefore, when we
pray against such-like temptations, we desire,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That God would restrain and prevent the irregularity
and pernicious tendency of our natural temper, which inclines
us to those sins which it is most prone to; or that he would
keep us from those sins that more easily beset us, by reason of
the propensity of our nature to commit them. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) That he would sanctify our affections and bring them
under the powerful influence of a principle of grace, which may
maintain a perpetual opposition to those habits of sin that are
daily leading us to turn aside from God, so that, whatever
temptations we meet with from objects without us, our souls
may be internally fortified against them, and disposed to hate
and avoid every thing that is contrary to his holy law, or tends
to his dishonour.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We shall now consider those temptations that arise from
Satan, who is, for this reason, called <i>the tempter</i>, Matt. iv. 3.
1 Thess. vi. 3. and he is also said to <i>enter into</i>, Luke xxii. 3.
and <i>fill the hearts</i> of sinners, Acts v. 3. As for the unregenerate,
they are wholly under his power: Therefore conversion
is called a <i>turning them from the power of Satan unto God</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>chap. xxvi. 18. There are, indeed, some who deny that Satan
has any hand in those temptations, which we are exposed to;
in which they are too much disposed to give into the error of
the Sadducees of old. And if they do not expressly deny the
existence of spirits, yet they will not allow that they have any
thing to do in this world: And, indeed, they think it impossible
for the Devil to give us any disturbance, seeing he is
shut up in chains of darkness, reserved to the judgment of the
great day; and, inasmuch as we often read in scripture, of
those things that he does against men in this world, they suppose
that all these are to be understood in a metaphorical
sense, and that nothing else is intended thereby, but the temptations
we meet with from men, or from our own lusts: These,
according to them, are the only devils that we need to fear.—This
error they are led into under a pretence of avoiding the
contrary extreme of those who seem to lay all the sins they
commit, to the Devil’s charge, rather than their own; when,
probably, he has nothing to do with them, but they wholly
proceed from their own corruptions: The middle way between
these two extremes, is, as I conceive, much more consonant to
scripture and experience, and rather to be acquiesced in. And
therefore we shall endeavour to prove, that we are often
tempted by Satan, as well as our own lusts; which will appear,
if we consider the following propositions.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, It is not unreasonable to suppose, that spirits may so
far have access to our souls, as <i>to suggest good or bad thoughts</i>;
for, being reasonable creatures, it is beyond dispute, that they
are able to converse with one another; and, if so, it contains
no absurdity to suppose, that they may, some way or other,
have conversation with the souls of men, which are capable of
having things internally suggested to them, as well as receiving
ideas from sensible objects, by means of our bodies, to which
they are united. As to the manner <i>how this is done</i>, we pretend
<i>not to determine it</i>, since it is sufficient to our present
purpose, to make it appear that we are exposed to temptations
from Satan, as well as our own selves.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, It is <i>obvious from scripture, that the Devil</i>, and his angels,
are <i>conversant in this lower world</i>: And accordingly he
is styled, <i>The prince of the power of the air</i>, Eph. ii. 2. <i>the
god of this world</i>, 2 Cor. iv. 4. And elsewhere he is said, to
<i>walk about, seeking whom he may devour</i>, 1 Pet. v. 8. And
whereas it is objected, that this is inconsistent with his being
shut up in hell: That may respect principally his state, as being
unchangeably separated and banished from God’s favourable
and comfortable presence; nevertheless, he may suffer him to
attempt many things against men in this world, for the trial of
the graces of his people, and the punishing of his enemies.—There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>is, indeed, a place of misery allotted for them, though
they may not be, at present, confined to it; which seems to be
implied in that request they made to our Saviour, that he
would not command them to <i>go into the deep</i>, Luke viii. 31.
by which, it is probable, the place of torment is intended, in
which they expect to be for ever shut up after the day of judgment;
and therefore they are represented elsewhere, as <i>crying
out, Art thou came hither to torment us before the time?</i> Matt.
viii. 29.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Our <i>first parent</i>, in innocency, <i>was tempted by the
Devil</i>, who made use of the serpent, by which he is said to
<i>speak to Eve</i>, Gen. iii. 1. <i>&amp; seq.</i> as has been proved elsewhere<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c012'><sup>[125]</sup></a>.
And our Saviour was also tempted by him, when led
by the Spirit into the wilderness for that purpose, Matt. iv. 1.
but neither of these could be said to be tempted by the lusts
of the flesh, as being inconsistent with that sinless state in which
our first parents were before they fell, and our Saviour always
was; and, it is certain, that the temptation offered to each of
them, was not only objective; but there were words spoken,
and a perverse method of reasoning made use of to ensnare
them: And they could not be tempted by men, for, in this
respect, they were alone; it therefore follows, that Satan was
the tempter to each of them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, There are several other <i>scriptures</i> which expressly
<i>prove, that Satan has sometimes tempted</i> persons to sin: Thus
we read, that <i>he stood up against Israel, and provoked David to
number them</i>, 1 Chron. xxi. 1. And elsewhere our Saviour
tells the Jews, <i>Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of
your father ye will do</i>; that is, you eagerly commit those sins
that he tempts you to. It is farther added, that he was <i>a murderer
from the beginning</i>; which cannot be understood otherwise
than of his murdering man, by tempting him to sin, and
prevailing; and it is also said, that <i>he abode not the truth</i>,
and is <i>a liar, and the father of it</i>, John viii. 44. that is, he deceives
us by his suggestions, and prevails on us, when complying
therewith, to deceive ourselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>This may give us occasion to enquire, how we may distinguish
those temptations which take their rise from Satan, from
others which proceed from ourselves. This is a very difficult
question to be resolved, because our <i>corrupt nature, for the
most part, tempts us to the same sins that Satan does</i>; therefore,
where there are <i>two causes of the same action</i>, it is <i>hard to distinguish</i>
one from the other: As when two candles are set up
in the same room, we cannot distinguish the light of one from
the light of the other. It is true, if the sins that we are tempted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>to by our lusts, on the one hand, and by Satan on the other,
had been described, as being of different kinds, we might more
easily determine the difference that there is between them. Or
if we had not the least inclination to comply with the temptation,
and were able to say, as our Saviour did, <i>The prince of
this world cometh, and hath nothing in me</i>, chap. xiv. 30. then
we might easily know where to fasten the charge of guilt; and
it would be no injustice to exculpate ourselves, and lay the
blame wholly on the Devil: But it is far otherwise with us,
by reason of the <i>corruption of our nature</i>, which <i>would render
us prone to sin, though Satan did not tempt</i> us to it. Therefore,
since we often contract guilt by complying with his temptations,
in like manner as he does by offering them; it is necessary
that something be said, that we may know when the
temptation is to be laid at our own door, and when at Satan’s, so
far as we are able to determine this matter: Therefore, let it
be considered,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, <i>If we are tempted to those sins which we cannot
think of but with the utmost abhorrence</i>; and we are so far from
entertaining any pleasure in the thing that we are tempted to,
that we take occasion from hence, to express the greatest aversion
to it, and would not comply with it for ten thousand
worlds; when we count the suggestion an invasion on our
souls, an affliction grievous to be borne; and, instead of compliance
therewith, are led hereby to the exercise of those
graces that are opposite to it: In such-like cases I humbly
conceive, we do not incur guilt by being tempted; but the sin
is wholly to be charged to Satan. Nevertheless,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, When we are pleased with the temptation, but frequently
meditate on the subject-matter thereof, and either
commit the sin we are tempted to; or, if we abstain from the
commission thereof, it is only out of fear or shame; and when
the propensity of our nature leads us, at other times, to those
sins which bear some resemblance to it; this argues, <i>that our
own lusts, as well as Satan, are joint causes of those</i> sins that
ensue hereupon. These things being considered, we shall proceed
to speak more particularly concerning Satan’s temptations;
and, in order thereunto, lay down some things, by way
of premisal, which relate to this matter, and then consider the
method he takes in managing them.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. There are some things to be premised in general, concerning
Satan’s temptations;</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) That, though he may tempt to sin, yet he <i>cannot force
the will</i>; for then the guilt would devolve wholly on himself
and not on us. It would certainly render our condition very
miserable, if it were impossible for us to resist his temptations;
for this would be to suppose, that we lie at the mercy of him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>who has more power to destroy us than we have to withstand
him. Besides this would be to extend the servitude of the will
of man beyond its due bounds; for, though it be not free to
what is spiritually or supernaturally good, we do not deny but
that it is free, as it has a power to avoid many sins, which,
upon this supposition, it would be inevitably hurried into. And
it would be <i>a refection on the providence of God</i>, so far to <i>leave
man</i> in the hands of Satan, as that hereby he should be laid
<i>under a necessity of sinning</i> and perishing without the choice
and consent of his own will, and consequently, his destruction
could not be said to be of himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Satan’s <i>power is not equal to his malice</i>; for he is under
divine restraints, and, indeed, <i>can do nothing against believers,
but by God’s permission</i>. This may be argued from our being
obliged to desire that God would <i>keep us from being tempted</i>,
that is, restrain the tempter, as well as enable us to resist him;
and if it were otherwise, no one could be saved; for Satan’s
malice is boundless, though he be not suffered to do what it
prompts him to. And this is a very great blessing to God’s
people; as it is a comfortable thing to consider, that they are
in his hands, who is a merciful Father; and not in Satan’s
power, who breathes forth nothing but revenge and cruelty:</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) As it is <i>not a sin to be tempted</i>, since our Saviour is
said to have been <i>in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
sin</i>, Heb. iv. 15. so on the other hand, <i>when we are pleased</i>,
and comply with the temptation, it will be <i>no sufficient excuse</i>
for us to allege, that <i>Satan had a great hand in it</i>, since, as we
have before observed, he can only tempt, but not force the
will; and how formidable soever he may be, by reason of the
greatness of his power and malice; yet we have this expedient
to make use of, as it should put us upon saying, the Lord rebuke
thee Satan.</p>

<p class='c006'>(5.) There is a <i>vast difference between</i> the condition of those
who are <i>converted</i>, and others, who are in an <i>unregenerate</i> state,
as to the event and consequence of Satan’s temptations. The
former, indeed, by reason of the remainders of corruption in
them, are <i>oftentimes foiled</i> and overcome thereby; but yet they
shall <i>not be wholly destroyed</i>; but God will <i>find out a way for
their recovery</i> out of the snare, in which they may, at any time,
be entangled: Whereas the latter are wholly under his power,
by <i>their own choice</i> and consent, and will remain so, till, by the
grace of God they are delivered from the dominion of darkness,
and translated into the kingdom of his dear Son. We
shall now consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The method in which Satan manages his temptations, in
order to his inducing men to sin. Sometimes he endeavours to
ensnare and deceive us <i>by his subtilty</i>: upon which account he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>is called <i>that old serpent, which deceiveth the whole world</i>. Rev.
xx. 2. and xii. 9. And elsewhere we read of <i>the depths of Satan</i>,
chap. ii. 24. that is, his deep-laid designs, and of his <i>wiles</i>,
Eph. vi. 11. which it is an hard matter to withstand; and he
is sometimes said to be <i>transformed into an angel of light</i>,
2 Cor. xi. 24. when he tempts to sin, under a pretence of our
bringing glory to God, as well as good to ourselves and others.
And there are other methods he takes, which, though managed
with equal subtilty, yet he appears, <i>not as an angel of light</i>,
pretending to help us in the way to heaven, but <i>as a roaring
lion</i>, rendering himself formidable, and not concealing his design
to devour, or make a prey of us, and to fill us with that
distress of conscience, that brings us to the very brink of despair:
These, as it is probable, the apostle intends by his <i>fiery
darts</i>, as contra-distinguished from his <i>wiles</i>. In the former
he shews himself a <i>tempter</i>, in the latter, an <i>accuser</i>. These
are the usual methods which he takes in managing his temptations:
and we shall consider them under four heads;</p>

<p class='c006'>1. His endeavouring to produce and strengthen the habits
of sin.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. What he does to prevent conviction of sin, or to hinder
the efficacy thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. His discouraging those who are under convictions from
closing with Christ by faith. And,</p>

<p class='c006'>4. His injecting blasphemous and atheistical thoughts into
the minds of men, and using endeavours to drive them to despair.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Satan endeavours <i>to produce and strengthen the habits of
sin</i>. These are generally attained by frequent acts, or by making
a progress in sin, by which the heart is more hardened;
and it is with greater difficulty that such are reclaimed from
it; of them the prophet speaks, when he says, <i>Can the Ethiopian
change his skin, or the leopard his spots; then may ye also
do good, that are accustomed to do evil</i>, Jer. xiii. 23. And in
order thereunto, we may observe that he does not usually
tempt, at first, to the vilest and most notorious acts of sin,
especially where he has ground to suspect that these temptations
will not be readily entertained or adhered to; this is the
case of those who retain some impressions of a religious education,
or are, at present, under the influence of restraining
grace: these are first tempted to commit lesser sins before they
proceed to greater. He generally begins with tempting to sins
of <i>omission</i>, or to <i>formality</i> and <i>indifferency</i> in the performing
of religious duties, or by pretending that God gives us some
indulgencies or allowance to commit those sins that our natural
constitution most inclines us to, and that we have been
mistaken, when we have thought that religion is so difficult a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>matter as some have pretended it to be; and that we may
safely follow a multitude, though it be in doing that, which is
in itself sinful; and that we are not to take an estimate of religion,
from the apprehensions which some melancholy persons
entertain of it; and that strictness in religion, is being righteous
overmuch; or striving against the stream, is a needless
precaution; and therefore we may consult our own honour
and reputation in the world, and give into that scheme of religion
that is uppermost; and that denying ourselves, taking up
the cross and following Christ; though it may be reckoned a
safe, yet it is not the only way to heaven. By this means the
habits of sin are strengthened, the heart hardened therein, and
persons proceed from one degree of impiety to another, till at
last, they abandon themselves to every thing that is vile and
profligate, and run with others, in all excess of riot. And, that
his design may be more effectually carried on, herein he suits
his temptations to every age and condition of life. Here we
shall consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) The method he takes with those who are in the prime
and flower of their age: Accordingly these he endeavours to
persuade, that it is <i>time enough for them to think of being religious
hereafter</i>; and that it is too austere and melancholy a
thing for them to pretend to it at present, as what is inconsistent
with those pleasures and youthful lusts, which are agreeable
to their age and condition of life. If they are children,
then he suggests to them, that they have time enough before
them; and when they are more advanced in years, they will
have a greater degree of understanding, and be better able to
take in the force of those arguments that are usually brought
to induce persons to lead a religious life; and then they may
make choice of it out of judgment. If they are servants, he
persuades them, that they have other business on their hands,
and that they had better stay till they are free from the engagements
which they are, at present, under, to their masters; and,
when they are at their own disposal, then it will be the fittest
time for them to embrace the ways of God. This temptation
carries in it the highest instance of presumption, tends greatly
to harden the heart in sin, and has been the ruin of multitudes.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) When persons are come to years of maturity, being no
longer children or servants, but about to engage in those secular
employments, which they are called to in the world, then
he has temptations of another nature to offer to them. He has
hitherto kept possession of their hearts, and desired them only
to wait for this age of life, and then they would have a more
convenient season to lead a religious life; but this convenient
season is not yet come; for there are other stratagems which
he now makes use of, to keep them in subjection to him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>Youthful lusts are now grown to a greater height, and the impressions
of a religious education, if they were favoured with
it, almost worn out; and it is no difficult matter for him to
persuade them, that the principal thing they are to be concerned
about, is their living comfortably in the world; and, that
they have now an opportunity to increase their substance, and
make provision for their future happiness therein; therefore
they ought to converse with those who are in the same station
of life with themselves: And he generally points out such associates,
which he tempts them to make choice of, that may
be a snare to them, whose conversation is very remote from
any thing that tends to promote religion and godliness. Sometimes
he endeavours to make them ashamed of the ways of
God, as though this were inconsistent with their reputation in
the world, especially with their present situation or condition
therein. And, on the other hand, if persons are poor and low
in the world, and find it difficult to maintain themselves or
families, then he persuades them that religion is not the business
which they are called to engage in, but they must rather
take pains to live; that God does not require more than he
gives, or expect, that they should spend a great deal of time
in religious duties, who have none to spare from that business,
which is necessary for their getting a livelihood in the world;
therefore this does not so much belong to them, as to others.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) If persons are arrived to old age, the last stage of life,
and have, as it were, their latter end in view, as not being far
from it, according to the course of nature; this is that age of
life which was formerly pretended, by Satan, to be the most
fit and proper season to entertain thoughts of religion in; and
it was in expectation hereof, that, when they were formerly
under any convictions, the general method they took to stifle
them, was by resolving, that they would apply themselves to
a religious life in old age. By this means the tempter has
hitherto beguiled them; and now he has other temptations to
present to them, which are suited to this age of life, whereby
he insinuates, that the weakness and infirmities of old age render
them unfit for religious duties. And, indeed, their hearts
have contracted such a degree of hardness, by a long continuance
in sin, that it is difficult for any thing to make an impression
on them. However, Satan endeavours to persuade them,
that, notwithstanding all the wickedness of their former life,
and their present impenitency for it, they may hope for salvation
from the mercy of God, though they continue still in a
state of unregeneracy, which is an instance of soul-destructive
presumption; or else, he tempts them utterly to despair of the
mercy of God, and tells them, that it is too late for them to
begin that work which they have put off to the extremity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>life; and by either of these methods he effectually brings about
their ruin. Thus concerning Satan’s suiting his temptations
to the several ages and conditions of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>But besides this, we may observe, that there are some methods
which he takes, that are agreeable to the temper and
disposition of those whom he assaults, that so he may not
shoot his arrows at random, without answering the end he designs
thereby; in which his subtilty farther appears; as,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] He observes those proper times in tempting men to sin,
wherein it is most likely that his temptations should take effect.
Therefore his assaults are generally most violent, when they
are least upon their guard, and give way to sloth and indolence;
or when the Spirit of God withdraws his influences, as
the consequence whereof, their faith is weak, and they not able
to make great resistance against his temptations, he crowds in
a great multitude of them at once, and so lays hold on this opportunity
to improve the success which he has gained against
them. And if they are afraid of the consequences of a compliance
therewith, he endeavours to stupify their souls, that
they may have no present apprehensions of the evil that would
ensue hereupon.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] He often takes occasion to raise in our minds some
doubts about the matter of sin or duty, whether, what he is
about to tempt us to, be lawful or unlawful; or how far a person
may venture to go in the way of temptation, and yet maintain
his integrity? which is generally the first step towards the
commission of those sins which we are tempted to.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] If shame or fear are like to hinder the success of the
temptation, he undertakes to find out some method of secrecy,
whereby public scandal may be avoided. Thus Joseph’s mistress
tempted him to sin, when Potiphar was absent, and <i>there
was none of the men of the house there within</i>, Gen. xxxix. 11.
and therefore he had no occasion to fear that his crime would
be detected. And sometimes he proceeds so far, as to insinuate,
that they may even hide themselves from the all-seeing
eye of God, and tempts them to say, <i>How doth God know?
Can he judge through the dark cloud? Thick clouds are a covering
to him, that he seeth not, and he walketh in the circuit of
heaven</i>, Job xxii. 13, 14. Thus the prophet Isaiah denounces
a woe against them that <i>seek deep to hide their counsel from the
Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth
us? and who knoweth us</i>, Isa. xxix. 15. and this method seldom
fails of answering his end, or prevailing against them,
who are hereby induced to a sinful compliance with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] If conscience be awakened, and deters them from adhering
to the temptation, from a sense of that guilt which they
will contract thereby; Satan is sometimes content to take the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>blame hereof upon himself, that they may think that they are
to be excused, by reason of the violence of the temptation,
which they could not well withstand.</p>

<p class='c006'>[5.] Sometimes he persuades them to throw the blame on
providence, as being the occasion of sin, or rendering it necessary
or unavoidable from our condition or circumstances
in the world, which is the highest injury that can be offered
to the divine Majesty. Thus Adam tacitly reproaches God,
when he says, <i>The woman, whom thou gavest to be with me,
she gave me of the tree, and I did eat</i>, Gen. iii. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>[6.] He often tempts men to presume on the mercy of God,
hoping that though they continue in sin, they shall obtain a
pardon from him. Or, since this is not to be expected without
sincere repentance, he tempts them to presume, that by the
influence of the Holy Spirit, they shall have this grace hereafter,
whereby their perishing in their iniquities may be prevented.
Thus concerning the methods which Satan takes to
produce and strengthen the habits of sin. We proceed,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. To consider how he endeavours to prevent our being
brought under conviction of sin; or, if we are convinced thereof,
to hinder its making any deep or lasting impression on us;
and this he does various ways,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) By dissuading others, who ought to deal faithfully with
us, from reproving sin committed by us. Thus Ezekiel, speaking
concerning the false prophets, says, that they <i>strengthened
the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his
wicked way, by promising him life</i>, Ezek. xiii. 22. Sometimes
he improves the consideration of our circumstances in the
world, to dissuade us from reproving sin in others, especially
if they are our superiors, or those whom we are dependent on,
or have some expectations from, lest we should make them
our enemies, and thereby lose some advantages, which we
hope to receive from them. And there are others whom he
does not wholly dissuade from reproving of sin; but there are
some circumstances attending the reproof, or the person that
gives it, that he lays hold of, which hinders it from taking effect,
whereby his end is no less answered than if sin had not
been reproved at all. As,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] When we reprove those that are notorious offenders,
and ought to be treated with a greater degree of sharpness,
with too much lenity, as though it were only a sin of infirmity,
by which means they are more hardened in the commission
of it. This was Eli’s fault in dealing with his sons, when
he said unto them, <i>Why do ye such things? for I hear of your
evil dealings by all this people: Nay, my sons, for it is no good
report that I hear; ye make the Lord’s people to transgress</i>, 1
Sam. ii. 23, 24. Whereas, he ought to have restrained them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>by those acts of severity, which the nature of the crime demanded.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] Satan often prevents the reproof from taking effect, by
inclining the reprover to use indecent behaviour in expressing
the haughtiness of his temper, as though there were no respect
due to superiors, as such, because they are worthy of reproof;
or else by expressing a kind of hatred against the person that
committed the sin; whereas, hatred ought to be principally directed
against the crime itself, while we convince those whom
we are reproving, that it is love to them, as well as zeal for the
glory of God that moves us to do this.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] Satan often hinders reproofs from taking effect, either
by tempting those who give them to commit the same sin, or,
at least, by persuading those against whom they are directed,
that there are other sins equally great, which they are chargeable
with, and therefore they ought to look to themselves, rather
than take notice of what is done by others.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Satan hinders the work of conviction, by endeavouring
to suppress the preaching of the word, or prevent the success
thereof when preached. As to the preaching of the word, this
is God’s ordinary way by which he convinces of sin; and Satan
sometimes stirs up those that are under his power and influence
to persecute or suppress the preaching of the gospel.
Thus the apostles were <i>commanded</i> by the Jews, <i>not to speak at
all, nor teach in the name of Jesus</i>, Acts iv. 18. and when they
refused to obey this command, they <i>put them in prison</i>, chap.
v. 18. This method has been taken, in all ages, by Satan’s instigation,
with a design to hinder the spreading of Christ’s interest
in this world, which, by the blessing of providence, has
been, notwithstanding, continued unto this day. Therefore,
there are other methods which he uses to hinder the success
of the word. Sometimes he does this by perverting them that
preach it; so that they endeavour to corrupt the word of God,
whereby the minds of men are turned away from that simplicity
that is in Christ; at other times he tempts them to be very
sparing in reproving sin, or to do this in a more general way,
as though their only design was to let their hearers know that
there are some sinners in the world, and not that they should
be brought under conviction of sin themselves. This is done
sometimes in compliance with the corruptions of those whom
they do not care to disoblige hereby; and others shun to declare
some of the most important truths of the gospel, and affect
such a method of preaching as has not a tendency to bring
that real advantage to the souls of men, as when it is delivered
with more zeal and faithfulness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, Satan endeavours to hinder the success of the
word, by stirring up the corruptions of those that attend upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>it; for which reason he is represented, by our Saviour, in the
parable of the <i>seed which fell by the way-side</i>, which the <i>fowls
came and devoured</i>, as <i>catching away</i> the word, Matt. xiii. 4,
19. By this means they are not much affected with it, nor endeavour
to retain it in their memories; and, sometimes he injects
vain thoughts under the word preached. This our Saviour
compares, in the parable but now mentioned, to the <i>seed
that fell among thorns</i>; and explains it of <i>the care of this world,
and the deceitfulness of riches, choaking the word</i>, ver. 7, 22.
And sometimes he endeavours to raise prejudices in the minds
of men, against what is delivered; so that the plainness of expression,
when addressed to the consciences of men, in such a
way, as that it has a tendency to bring them under conviction,
is contemned, and called a low, mean way of address, and disliked,
because it is not delivered with that elegancy of style,
or ingenious turn of thought, that is adapted rather to please
the ear, than affect the hearts of those that hear it. By those
methods Satan endeavours to hinder persons from being
brought under conviction: But if their consciences are, notwithstanding
this, awakened under the word, or, by some providences
which God often makes use of for that end; then
there are methods of another kind, which Satan uses, to prevent
convictions from making any deep or lasting impression
on them. As,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] By endeavouring to make the soul easy, from the consideration
of the universal depravity of human nature; and accordingly
he insinuates, that all have reason to accuse themselves
of sins that would tend to their disquietude, if they
made so narrow a search into their hearts as these do, or had
such formidable thoughts of the consequences thereof as they
have. Here he produces many examples of those who have
been quiet and easy in their own minds, though they had as
much ground to perplex and torment themselves with such-like
melancholy thoughts as they have; yet they go on in a course
of sin, without any checks of conscience, and, as Job speaks,
<i>spend their days in wealth</i>, or, as it is in the margin, in mirth,
<i>and in a moment go down to the grave</i>, Job vii. 22. being resolved
to give way to nothing that shall disturb their peace,
or render their lives uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] If this stratagem will not take effect, inasmuch as they
are sensible, that while they remain in an unconverted state,
they can have no solid foundation for peace, then he endeavours
to persuade them, <i>that the work of conversion is over,
and that conviction of sin, though destitute of faith, is true repentance</i>,
or that a partial reformation, and abstaining from
some gross and scandalous sins, or engaging in the external
duties of religion, especially with some degree of raised affections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>therein, is a sufficient ground for them to conclude, that
they are in a state of grace; and if they resolve to go on in
this way, he puts them upon depending and relying on their
own righteousness, and expecting to be justified thereby, without
seeing a necessity of laying hold on what Christ has done
and suffered, in order to the removing the guilt of sin; and,
so long as they continue in this way, they shall meet with no
disturbance from Satan, this not being the method which God
has prescribed for our attaining justification, or that peace
which flows from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] He puts them <i>upon making vows and resolutions in their
own strength</i>, that they will perform several religious duties
with the greatest exactness, and abstain from those sins which
he is sensible they will commit, if not prevented by the grace
of God, that so, by too great confidence in their own strength,
they may provoke him to leave them to themselves; and, as
the consequence thereof, they soon break their resolutions, and
bring themselves under greater perplexities than they were in
before: And, then to make them easy, he endeavours to persuade
them, that God does not require them to lead so strict
a life as they seemed determined to do, but has allowed them
some innocent liberties, as he calls them, in giving way to
those sins which their condition in life renders necessary; and,
as he had before tempted them to rely on their own strength,
now he tempts them to carnal security, and a slothful, stupid
frame of spirit, whereby they will be rendered more receptive
of those temptations he has to offer, to turn them aside from
that strictness in religion, which they before resolved to maintain.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] Satan dazzles <i>their eyes with the glittering vanities of
this world</i>, that he might divert their minds from serious
thoughts about, or any concern for a better; and if their secular
callings are attended with some incumbrances, through the
multiplicity of business, or the constant care they are obliged to
take to live in the world; then he alleges the inconsistency
hereof, with their giving way to those convictions of sin which
will be an hindrance to the necessary business of life. Thus
concerning the method which Satan uses to prevent conviction
of sin, or to hinder the efficacy thereof: But inasmuch
as this does not always take effect; especially when convictions
make a deep impression upon us. We proceed to
consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Those methods that are used by Satan, to hinder persons
from closing with Christ, and believing in him. And this he
does,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st</i>, By endeavouring to <i>keep them in ignorance</i> of the great
doctrines of the gospel; and, as the consequence thereof, turning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>them aside to embrace those errors, which are inconsistent
with faith in Christ; and in order thereto, he suggests, that it
does not belong to them, to press after the knowledge of the
sense of scripture, but to persons of learning, or those who are
called to preach or defend the truth; and that it is enough for
them to have some general notions of the doctrines of religion,
whereby they may be induced to practise those moral virtues
which their station in life engages them to, and to leave the
more abstruse parts thereof, to those whose inclination leads
them thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, he improves the different sentiments of men about
the doctrines of the gospel, to answer this end, and infers from
thence, that since one asserts one thing for truth, and another
the contrary, that therefore there is nothing certain in religion;
so that they are safest who keep clear of all these controverted
matters; and among them he includes the doctrine of justification
by faith in Christ. This method of temptation leads men
to scepticism, and, if complied with, is inconsistent with faith
in Christ; and the consequence hereof is, their imbibing those
doctrines that tend to sap the very foundation of revealed religion.
And if they pretend to adhere to any scheme of doctrine,
it is generally such an one, as has a tendency to strike at
the divinity and glory of Christ, the necessity of his satisfaction,
or of our justification, by his imputed righteousness, or
denying the divinity of the Holy Ghost, and the need we have
of his powerful operations in the work of regeneration, conversion,
and sanctification. These are the doctrines on which
our faith is built; therefore, to deny them, is not only inconsistent
with our closing with Christ, as being the result of the
alienation of our minds from God; but it is agreeable to the
working of Satan in the children of disobedience, whereby he
answers his character, as a deceiver, as well as a tempter.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, Satan endeavours to hinder men from believing in
Christ, by <i>persuading them to hope for salvation from the mercy
of God</i>, without any regard to the display of this attribute in
Christ, as our Mediator, or faith in him, without which we
have no ground to conclude, that we shall obtain mercy from
him: Or, since faith is necessary to salvation, he persuades
them to take up with such a kind of faith as consists only in
a general assent to some things contained in scripture, without
the exercise of other graces that are inseparably connected
with, and flow from it; and if they have no other notion of
saving faith than this, it is no wonder that Satan, by his false
reasoning, carries on the temptation yet farther, and persuades
them, that this is in their own power, and that it is an easy
matter to believe, which is a certain indication that they are
destitute of saving faith. Thus we have considered Satan as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>endeavouring to strengthen the habits of sin, hinder the work
of conviction, or prevent its taking effect; and using methods
to keep those who are under convictions, from closing with
Christ by faith. We now proceed to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'>4. His injecting atheistical and blasphemous thoughts into
the minds of men, and using his utmost endeavours to
despair.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) He sometimes <i>injects atheistical and blasphemous
thoughts into the minds of men</i>. His nature inclines him to
hate and oppose God; and his malice breaks forth in tempting
men to blaspheme his perfections: Thus some are represented
as <i>opening their mouths in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme
his name and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven</i>, Rev.
xiii. 6. which they do by the instigation of Satan: However,
there is a vast difference between those blasphemous thoughts,
which are injected into the minds of wicked men, and those
which are oftentimes complained of by the believer. In the
former, the Devil enstamps his own image upon them, and
they are like a spark falling into combustible matter, which
immediately sets it on fire: The latter is like a flash of fire that
lights upon water, without doing any execution. We read of
some who are entirely under his dominion, who <i>blaspheme the
God of heaven, because of their pains and their sores, and repented
not of their deeds</i>, chap. xvi. 11. But there are others
into whom he injects such-like thoughts, which are a grief and
burden to them. Some are tempted to deny the being or
providence of God; and others to have unworthy and injurious
thoughts of the divine perfections; which cannot be reckoned
any other than blasphemy, and, so far as they proceed from,
us, bring with them a very great degree of guilt. That believers
themselves have been sometimes guilty hereof, appears
from what the Psalmist utters in words, when he says, <i>Is his
mercy clean gone for ever? Hath God forgotten to be gracious</i>,
Psal. lxxvii. 8, 9. And, indeed, it is no uncommon thing for
believers to complain of their having such injurious and unworthy
thoughts of the divine perfections, that they dare not
utter in words; which fills them with the greatest uneasiness;
Therefore it is necessary for us to enquire, when these blasphemous
suggestions take their rise from ourselves, and when
from Satan?</p>

<p class='c006'>It is certain, that sometimes they proceed from ourselves:
Thus our Saviour says, <i>Out of the heart proceed blasphemies
that defile a man</i>, Matt. xv. 19. and we have reason to charge
ourselves therewith, when they arise from, or are accompanied
with other presumptuous sins; or when we do not strive
against, but rather give way to them, and other suggestions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>of Satan, which tends to God’s dishonour, grieves the Holy
Spirit, and defiles our own consciences.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, on the other hand, we may humbly hope and trust, that
they are rather to be charged on Satan than ourselves, when
they are the result of some bodily distemper, as in those that
are under the prevailing power of melancholy, in whom it may
be observed, that when by the use of natural means, the distemper
is abated, and the constitution mended, these blasphemous
suggestions cease. Moreover, when our souls tremble at
the temptation, and oppose it with the utmost abhorrence, as
our Saviour did, when the Devil tempted him to <i>fall down and
worship him</i>; to whom he immediately replies, <i>Get thee hence,
Satan</i>, chap. iv. 9, 10. Again, when we confess, and can appeal
to the heart-searching God, that we are so far from having
any inclination to comply with the suggestion, that nothing is
more grievous to us, than to be assaulted with it: and especially
when we take occasion from hence, to exercise that
reverential fear of the divine Majesty, that is opposite thereunto.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) As Satan gives disturbance by blasphemous suggestions,
so he uses endeavours to <i>drive persons to despair</i>. We
observed, under a foregoing head, that so long as he can persuade
any one to take up with a false peace, and fancy himself
secure though going on in a course of rebellion against God,
he gives him but little uneasiness, endeavouring rather to increase
his stupidity, than awaken his fears. Before this, he attempted
to bring ruin upon him, by suggesting those temptations
that led to presumption, and pretended to him, that all
things were well, when the ground was sinking under him,
and his hope built on a sandy foundation: But, when the
frame of his spirit is somewhat altered, and he is brought to a
sense of his miserable condition; so that none of those stupifying
medicines that have been used, will heal the wound;
then Satan endeavours to persuade him, that his condition is
hopeless, or that there is no help for him in God. This
temptation believers, as well as the unregenerate, are sometimes
liable to; of which, we have many instances in scripture,
besides those that are matter of daily experience. But
it may be observed, that there is this difference between the one
and the other, in that we scarce ever read of a believer’s despair;
but we have, at the same time, something added, which
either argues his faith in God, or, that there was a mixture of
hope, which was like a beam of light shining in darkness:
Thus the Psalmist, in Psal. lxxxviii. expresses himself like one
in the depths of despair; yet it may be observed, that he addresses
himself to God, in ver. 1. as <i>the Lord God of his salvation</i>.
And when the church is represented in Lam. iii. 18. as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>saying, <i>My hope is perished from the Lord</i>; it is considered afterwards
as encouraging itself in him, as in ver. 24. <i>The Lord
is my portion, saith my soul, therefore will I hope in him</i>; and,
in ver. 31. <i>For the Lord will not cast off for ever</i>. But when
unbelievers are tempted to despair, it is attended with an obstinate
resolution to go on in a course of sin, and a total withdrawing
themselves from the ordinances, or instituted means
of grace. Thus when Cain complains that his <i>punishment was
greater than he could bear</i>; it is said concerning him, that <i>he
went out from the presence of the Lord</i>, Gen. iv. 13, 16. In
this case despair, especially if it does not proceed from a bodily
distemper, as it sometimes does, is a sad mark of a person’s
being under the dominion of Satan, who was before a tempter,
but now proves a tormentor to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we may take occasion to consider how Satan proceeds
against men in tempting them to despair.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>1st.</i> He <i>takes the fittest opportunity</i>, when we are most like
to be overcome by his temptation; <i>he observes our constitution
when most addicted to melancholy</i>, and therefore more easily led
to despair: He also takes notice of some circumstances of providence
that we are brought under, which are more than ordinarily
afflictive, and tend to deject and render us more receptive
of this temptation, in which he endeavours to add weight
to our burden, and depress our spirits under it: He also lays
hold on those times, more especially <i>when we are under divine
desertion</i>; and, as the consequence hereof, our faith is weak,
and very much indisposed to seek help from God. Moreover,
he often takes occasion, <i>from some great fall and miscarriage</i>
which we have been guilty of, whereby we have grieved
the Holy Spirit, and wounded our own consciences, to aggravate
our crime, so far that from hence we may conclude our
state to be altogether hopeless.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>2dly</i>, He endeavours <i>to stop all the springs of comfort</i>, that
might fortify us against, or afford us any relief under this
temptation; and accordingly he turns our thoughts from the
promises of the covenant of grace, and persuades the soul to
conclude that they are not made to himself; therefore he
ought not to apply them to himself for his comfort; and to determine
peremptorily against himself, that he is not elected to
salvation; not from any marks of reprobation that he finds in
himself, but by entering into God’s secret counsels, and pretending
to search the records of heaven, which he has no warrant
to look into, (in which respect despair contains in it a
mixture of sinful presumption,) and, at the same time, he has
a secret aversion to converse with those who are able to speak
a word in season to him; and if any endeavours are used to
convince him that the mercy of God is infinite, his thoughts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>are not as our thoughts, and that the merit of Christ extends
itself to the chief of sinners, it is all to no purpose, for his general
reply, to this and all other arguments of the like nature,
is that this belongs not to him, or his iniquities have excluded
him from the divine favour.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>3dly</i>, Satan endeavours to <i>hinder a soul at this time, from
waiting on God in ordinances</i>. As for the Lord’s supper, he
not only dissuades him from attending on it, but endeavours to
insinuate, that, in partaking of it in times past, he has <i>eat and
drunk</i> his own <i>damnation</i>, giving a perverse sense of that scripture,
1 Cor. xi. 29. which, as appears from the context, is not
to be applied to weak believers, but to such as engage in this
ordinance, in a profane and irreverent manner, as though it
were not a divine institution, and without any desire of obtaining
spiritual mercies from God therein; and the word which
we render <i>damnation</i>, ought to be rendered <i>judgment</i>, denoting
that they expose themselves to temporal, as well as spiritual
judgments in this world for this wickedness; not that
they are from hence to conclude, that their eternal damnation
will unavoidably ensue hereupon: And therefore the design of
this scripture, is to lead to repentance, and not to despair. As
for the word preached, he concludes, that every thing which is
delivered therein, contains an indictment against him, and
there he cannot endure to hear it: And, as for prayer, Satan
discourages him from it, by pretending that he is not in a
right frame for the performance of this duty, and by giving a
false sense of such scriptures as these, in Prov. xxviii. 9. <i>He
that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer
shall be abomination</i>; and, in chap. xxi. 27. <i>The sacrifice of
the wicked is abomination</i>; the meaning of which is, not that
the duty itself is sinful because performed by sinners, or that
God hates them the more for praying, but that he hates the
hypocrisy, formality, and other sins committed by them, when
engaged in this duty; so that they should rather strive and
pray against this unbecoming frame of spirit, than lay aside
the duty itself, as they are tempted to do.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>4thly</i>, Satan also makes use of false reasoning, by which he
endeavours to answer this end; as,</p>

<p class='c006'>[1.] He puts them upon concluding, that <i>because they have
no grace, therefore they never shall have it</i>; which method of
reasoning, if it were just, must be applied to all unregenerate
sinners; and then we must conclude, that the whole work of
conversion in this world, is at an end; which, blessed be God,
it is not.</p>

<p class='c006'>[2.] He farther argues, that because they have lived a great
while in a <i>course of sin</i>, and their hearts are <i>very much hardened
thereby</i>; therefore they cannot be broken, or their wound is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>incurable, and there are no healing medicines; which is to set
limits to the almighty power and grace of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>[3.] Satan farther induces them to conclude, that there is
something uncommon in their case, that they are greater sinners
than ever obtained mercy, which is more than it is possible
for them to know; however, they are tempted to apply
this presumptuous and discouraging suggestion to themselves
to heighten their despair, and hinder the force of any argument
that may be brought to the contrary.</p>

<p class='c006'>[4.] The most common argument which Satan uses to induce
persons to despair, is, that they have sinned against light,
and the convictions of their own consciences, grieved and
quenched the Spirit of God; and therefore they are inclined
to think that they have committed the unpardonable sin. This
is often alleged by persons against themselves, though, at
the same time, they know not what that sin is, and regard
not any thing that is said to convince them, that they have
committed it; and, indeed, their very fears that they have,
and the desires they express that it were otherwise with
them, are an undeniable argument that they are mistaken
in the judgment which they pass on themselves, by adhering
to Satan’s suggestions, leading them to despair<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c012'><sup>[126]</sup></a>. Thus we
have given some account of the great variety of temptations
which we are exposed to from the world, the flesh and the
Devil. We are now to consider,</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Secondly</i>, How we are to pray, that we may not be led
into temptation; or, if we are, by what means we may be
delivered from the evil consequences that will arise from our
compliance therewith. An hour of temptation is not only
afflictive, but dangerous, by reason of the united assaults
of those enemies that we have to deal with. The world continually
presents objects that are agreeable to corrupt nature;
and Satan is unwearied in his endeavours, to turn us aside
from God thereby, that he may have us in his own power,
and drive us from one degree of impiety to another: Therefore,
though it is not impossible to be tempted without sin,
yet it is exceeding difficult; and therefore, as we are to take
heed, that we do not go in the way of temptation; so we
are to address ourselves to God, that he would keep us from
it, if it be his will.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are not, indeed, absolutely to pray against it, as we
are to pray against sin, which it is not possible for us to
commit, without contracting guilt; whereas we may be tempted
to sin, and yet come off conquerors over it: But, since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>the enterprize itself is hazardous, the conflict difficult, and
the event, with respect to us, uncertain, we should rather
desire, that, if God has not some gracious ends to answer
thereby, which are, at present, unknown to us, he would be
pleased to prevent it. The case is the same as though we
were apprehensive of an infectious distemper raging amongst
us, which we are to pray against; though God could, by
his power, preserve us, in particular, from the ill consequences
thereof; or, if we were informed, that an enemy laid
wait secretly for our lives, it is possible for God to deliver
us out of his hand; yet if the matter were referred to our
own choice, we would rather desire that he may not be suffered
to assault us. Thus we are to pray, that God would
keep us from temptation; though we are not, at the same
time, to question his power, or distrust his providence, as
though he could not carry us safely through it; which we
are to hope that he will do, if he suffers us to be tempted.
Neither are we to suppose, that we can be altogether free
from those temptations that arise from the imperfection of
this present state, in which we must expect to be subject to
the perpetual lustings of the flesh against the spirit: Therefore
we are principally to direct our prayers to God, that
he would keep us from falling by the temptation, or else,
that he would recover us, when fallen, prevent the evils, that
would otherwise ensue, and over-rule our sinful compliance
therewith, to his own glory, and our future advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. We are to pray, that he would keep us from falling
by the temptation, that it may be like a wave dashing against
a rock, which remains unmoved thereby, or like a dart shot
against a breast-plate of steel, which only blunts the point
thereof, and returns it back without doing any execution.
Now God prevents our failing by temptation, either by his
restraining or renewing grace: The former of these is common
to the regenerate and the unregenerate; and where there
is nothing more than this, it chiefly consists in some alteration
made in the natural temper, or present inclinations of men,
whereby sin, though it remains unmortified, is, nevertheless abstained
from, like a river that is kept from overflowing a country,
not by ceasing to be fluid in its own nature, but by being
contained within its proper banks. These restraints, in some,
proceed from that change which providence makes in their outward
condition or circumstances in the world; so that those
temptations, which, before this, they were so ready to comply
with, are either discontinued, or offered without success; as
when a person is bowed down with some affliction, that it gives
a different turn to his passions, whereby, as Job speaks, the
<i>heart is made soft</i>, Job xxiii. 16. in a natural way, by those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>troubles that tend to depress the spirits. Sometimes he is unexpectedly
surprized with a fit of sickness, which gives him a
near view of death and another world, and then the violence
of the temptation, for the present, ceases, or at least, he is deterred
from complying with it; and it may be, his spirits are
decayed, his constitution weakened, and his natural vigour
abated hereby, so that he has no inclination to commit some
sins which he was formerly addicted to. Others want leisure
to pursue those lusts which they are habitually prone to, being
engaged in a hurry of business, or conflicting with many difficulties
for the subsisting of themselves and families: These
are not exposed to those temptations that often attend a slothful
and indolent way of living: Or it may be, they are separated
from their former associates, who have been partners
with them in sin, and tempters to it. And sometimes there is
a sudden thought injected into their minds, which fills them
with an inward fear and dread of the consequence of committing
those sins which are more gross and notorious. This is
the result of an awakened conscience; whereby persons are
kept from the commission of many sins, by the restraints of
common providence, though they are, notwithstanding, in a
state of unregeneracy, and sin in general remains unmortified.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, on the other hand, the believer is preserved from it by
the power of sanctifying grace, whereby an habitual inclination
is wrought in him, to detest the sin that he is tempted to; and
the Spirit of God, by his immediate interposure, internally disposes
him to exercise the contrary graces; which proceed
from a principle of filial fear and love to God, together with a
sense of gratitude for all the benefits that he has received from
him; so that in repelling a temptation, he says, with Joseph,
<i>How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God</i>, Gen.
xxxix. 9.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We are also to pray, that God would prevent those evil
consequences, which very often attend such-like temptations;
that our hearts may not be hardened through the deceitfulness
of sin, that we may not willingly yield ourselves bond-slaves
to Satan, or take pleasure in those sins which we have been
tempted to commit: and that we may not be exposed hereby
to divine desertion, how much soever we have deserved it.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We are likewise to pray, that God would recover, or bring
us out of the pit, into which we are fallen, that hereby Satan
may not take occasion, after he has overcome, to insult us, that
we may not be given to a perpetual backsliding; but that our
souls may be <i>restored</i>, and we <i>led in the paths of righteousness
for his name’s sake</i>, Psal. xxiii. 3.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>4. If we have fallen by a temptation we are farther to pray,
that God would over-rule it to his own glory, and our spiritual
advantage. Though there be nothing good in sin, yet God can
bring good out of it; and this he does when he humbles the
soul for it, and makes him afraid of going near the brink of
the pit, into which he fell, inclines him to be more watchful,
that, by indulging some sins, he may not lay himself open to
those temptations that would lead him to the commission of
many others. This will also induce him to depend on Christ
by faith, as being sensible of his inability to resist the least
temptation without him. And it will excite in him the greatest
thankfulness to God, who has found a way for his escape
out of the snare wherein he was entangled, by which means
he will receive abundant advantage, and God will be greatly
glorified.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we have considered God’s people as exposed to various
temptations, and how they are to direct their prayers to him,
agreeably thereunto, pursuant to what our Saviour has taught
us in this petition; which, that we may farther enlarge upon
in our meditations, we may express ourselves to God in prayer
to this purpose; “We draw nigh to thee, O our God and
Father, as those who are exposed to many difficulties, by
reason of the snares and temptations that attend us. We find
it hard to pass through the world without being allured and
drawn aside from thee, by the vanities thereof, or discouraged
and made uneasy by those afflictions which are inseparable
from this present state: But that which gives us the
greatest ground of distress and trouble, and makes us an
easy prey to our spiritual enemies, is, the deceitfulness and
treachery of our own hearts, whereby we are prone to yield
ourselves the servants of sin and Satan. Every age and condition
of life has been filled with temptations, which we
have been very often overcome by. We therefore implore
the powerful aids of thy grace, that we may be kept in the
hour of temptation. Enable us to overcome the world, to
mortify and subdue our corrupt inclinations, and to stand
against all the wiles and fiery darts of the Devil. Let us
not be tempted to presume of being happy without holiness,
or enjoying the benefits that are purchased by Christ, without
faith in him. May we also be freed from all unbecoming
thoughts of thy divine perfections, and not give way to
any temptations that may lead us to despair of thy mercy,
which thou art pleased to extend to the chief of sinners.
We farther beg, though with submission to thy will, that we
may be kept from the temptations of our grand adversary,
because we are sensible of our own weakness and inability to
resist him; nevertheless, we are confident that we can do all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>things by thine assistance: Therefore, if thou sufferest us to
be tempted, appear in our behalf at that time, that we may
be made more than conquerors; and when we fall by temptation,
let us not be utterly cast down, but upheld with thine
hand, and let thy strength be made perfect in our weakness;
and, in the end, bring us safely to that happy state, where
there is neither sin nor temptation; when we shall be delivered
from all the evils of this present state, that thou mayest
have the glory, and we may praise thee throughout the ages
of eternity.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>Quest. CXCVI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Quest. CXCVI.</span> <i>What doth the conclusion of the Lord’s
prayer teach us?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The conclusion of the Lord’s prayer, [which is, <i>For
thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory for ever, Amen</i>]
teacheth us to enforce our petitions with arguments, which
are to be taken, not from any worthiness in ourselves, or in
any other creature, but from God; and with our prayers, to
join praises, ascribing to God alone eternal sovereignty, omnipotency,
and glorious excellency; in regard whereof, as he
is able and willing to help us, so we, by faith, are emboldened
to plead with him that he would, and quietly to rely upon
him that he will fulfil our requests, and to testify this our
desire, and assurance, we say, <i>Amen</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we are taught to begin our prayers with those expressions
of reverence, becoming the Majesty of God, when we
draw nigh to him; so we are to conclude them with a doxology,
or an ascription of that glory which is due to his name;
whereby praise is joined with prayer, and we encouraged to
hope, that he will hear and answer our petitions.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the conclusion of the Lord’s prayer, we are directed to
ascribe to God <i>the kingdom, the power, and the glory for ever</i>;
and to sum up all with that comprehensive word, <i>Amen</i>. This
may be considered in two respects,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As we hereby express the due regard we have to the divine
perfections: And,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. As we improve or make use of them as so many arguments
or pleas in prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. We shall consider this doxology as containing the sense
we have of the divine perfections. Accordingly,</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) We say, <i>Thine is the kingdom</i>; whereby his sovereignty
and universal dominion over all creatures, is acknowledged
as he has a right to every thing that he gave being to: And,
as this is more especially a branch of his relative glory, since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>the idea of a king connotes subjects, over whom his dominion
is exercised; so it supposes in us an humble expression of subjection
to him, and dependence on him for all things that we
enjoy or hope for. We also consider him as having a right to
make use of all creatures at his pleasure; inasmuch as the
earth is his, and the fulness thereof: And, as we are intelligent
creatures, we profess our obligation to yield obedience to
his revealed will, and are afraid of incurring his displeasure
by rebelling against him, with whom is terrible Majesty: And
when we take a view of him; as seated on a throne of grace,
and his government as extended to his church, upon which
account he is adored as <i>king of saints</i>, Rev. xv. 3. we hope for
his safe protection and for all the blessings which he bestows
on those whom he governs in a way subservient to their everlasting
salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We adore him as a God of infinite power, <i>Thine is the
power</i>. Dominion without power will not be sufficient to
maintain its rights; therefore, since God is described as having
the kingdom belonging to him, or being the governor
among the nations; his attribute of power ought next to be
considered, whereby he can, without the least difficulty, secure
the welfare and happiness of his subjects, and bring to
nought the designs of his enemies; or, as it is elegantly expressed,
<i>look on every one that is proud, and bring him low, and
tread down the wicked in their place, hide them in the dust together,
and bind their faces in secret</i>, Job xl. 12, 13.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) It is farther added, <i>Thine is the glory</i>. This may be
taken in two senses; either as including in it all his perfections,
whereby he is rendered glorious in the eyes of angels
and men; so that there is nothing that we esteem beautiful or
excellent in the whole system of created beings, but what is
deformed, and, as it were, vanishes and sinks into nothing,
when compared with him: Or else, the meaning of the expression
is, that all the praise and honour that arises from
every thing that is done in the world, which appears great and
excellent, or has a tendency to raise our esteem and admiration,
is to be ascribed to him; whereby we disclaim the least
shadow or appearance of divine honour, which we are ready,
upon all occasions to acknowledge to be due to him alone:
Thus we adore him as having all divine perfections, when we
say, <i>Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>And it is farther added, that they belong to him <i>for ever
and ever</i>; whereby it is intimated, that whatever changes there
may be in the nature or condition of created beings, he is unchangeably
the same, and therefore will remain glorious in
himself, and be for ever admired and adored by all his saints,
whose happiness depends upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>2. We shall consider these divine perfections, as they afford
us so many arguments, or pleas, in prayer, from whence we
take encouragement to expect a gracious answer from him, as
appears from that <i>illative</i> particle, FOR, which is prefixed to
this doxology. Therefore we may consider it as subjoined to
the foregoing petitions, as the strongest motive to induce us
to hope, that the blessings we pray for, shall be granted us;
accordingly we disclaim all worthiness in ourselves, and desire
that our name or righteousness should not be mentioned; but
that the whole revenue of glory may redound to God, as all
our expectation is from him. We might here apply the several
arguments or pleas contained herein, to every one of the
foregoing petitions; which would tend very much to enforce
them, and afford matter for our farther enlargement in prayer:
But I shall rather chuse to reduce the subject-matter thereof
to the two general heads, under which they are contained; and
accordingly to shew how we may make use of those arguments
that are taken from the kingdom, power, and glory, belonging
to God, for ever and ever, in our praying for those things that
concern his glory, agreeably to what we are directed to ask
for in the three first petitions; or our temporal or spiritual advantage,
as in the three last.</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) As to what respects the glory of God in the world, viz.
that his name may be hallowed, his kingdom advanced, and
his will be done: Therein we pray, that, as he is a great King,
the blessed and only Potentate, the Governor of the world and
the church, he would sanctify his glorious name; that his interest
may be maintained, and prevail against every thing that
opposes it, that he would take to himself his great power and
reign; and, since the success of the gospel, and the advancement
of his kingdom of grace, is a work surpassing finite
power, and there are many endeavours used to weaken and
overthrow it; we trust, we hope, we plead with him, for the
glory of his name, that he would give a check to, and defeat
the designs of his and our enemies, that the enlargement of
his kingdom may not be obstructed, nor his subjects disheartened,
whilst Satan’s kingdom, that is set in opposition to it,
makes such sensible advances, and prevails so much against it.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, that his name may be sanctified by his people, and
his kingdom advanced in this lower world, we farther pray,
that his subjects may be inclined to obey, and submit to his
will in all things; or, that it may be done on earth as it is in
heaven: Therefore, when we ascribe the kingdom, power, and
glory to him, we do, in effect, say, “Lord, what would become
of this wretched world, if it were not under thy gracious
government, which is its glory and defence? Thou
sittest on the throne of thy holiness, which thou hast established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>of old: Therefore, we are encouraged to hope, that
thou wilt not forsake thy people, who are called by thy name,
nor suffer thine interest to be trampled on, nor thy name
profaned by those who say, Who is the Lord, that we should
obey him? Thine arm is not shortened, that thou canst not
save, since thine is the power; and therefore nothing is too
hard for thee. Thou hast given us ground to expect, that
thou wilt shew thy people marvellous things; and thou hast
promised, that all nations shall bow down before thee and
serve thee; and that the kingdoms of this world shall become
the kingdoms of Christ: This thou canst easily accomplish
by thine almighty power, though it be too hard for man.—Thou
art never at a loss for instruments to fulfil thy pleasure;
for all things are in thy hand: Neither, indeed, dost
thou need them; for, by thy powerful word, thou canst cause
light to shine out of darkness, and revive thy work in the
midst of the years, that thy people may rejoice and be glad
in thy salvation. Take the work, therefore, into thine own
hand, and, thereby, give us occasion to admire and ascribe
to thee the glory that is due to thy name.”</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) We are to consider, how we may plead for temporal
or spiritual blessings, as making use of this argument, that the
kingdom, power, and glory, belong to God; accordingly, we
pray, that he would give us that portion of the good things
of life, that he sees necessary for us, and that we may enjoy his
blessing with it, in order to our being prepared for a better,
<i>q. d.</i> “Give us daily bread; for the earth is thine, and the
fulness thereof: Thou hast subdued us to thyself, and hast
told us, that thou wilt surely do us good, and bring us, at
last, to thy heavenly kingdom: Therefore we humbly wait
upon thee, that we may not be suffered to faint by the way,
or be destitute of those blessings that are needful for us in
our present condition. Thou art able to supply all our wants:
We have hitherto been upheld by thy power, and thou hast
sometimes done great things for us, that we looked not for,
and hast been our refuge and strength, a very present help
in every time of trouble. Thou hast granted us life and
favour, and thy visitations have preserved our spirits; what
thou hast given us we have gathered; thou hast opened thy
hand, and filled us with good. And, as the treasures of thy
bounty are not exhausted, nor thy power diminished; so we
desire to exercise a constant dependence on thee, and to
hope in thy mercy; that, as thou hast given us those better
things that accompany salvation, thou wilt also bestow upon
us what thou seest needful for us in our way to it; which
will not only redound to our comfort, but thy glory; who
givest food to all flesh; for thy mercy endureth for ever.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>As for those spiritual blessings that we stand in need of,
we encourage ourselves to hope for them; and accordingly,
when we pray for forgiveness of sin, we consider God as sitting
upon a throne of grace, and inviting us to come and receive
a pardon from his hand: Therefore we say, “Lord, thou art
ready to forgive, and thereby to lay eternal obligations on
thy subjects, to love and fear thee; if thou shouldst resolve
to display thy vindictive justice in punishing sin, according
to the demerit thereof, thy kingdom of grace would be at an
end; but thou encouragest us to hope for forgiveness, that
hereby grace may reign through righteousness unto life
eternal. And, as thou art a God of infinite power, we beg
that thou wouldst thereby work in us those graces that flow
from, and are the evidences of our having obtained forgiveness,
that being delivered from the guilt of sin, we may walk
before thee in newness of life. We also ask this privilege,
as what thou bestowest for Christ’s sake, that hereby he may
be glorified as the purchaser of this blessing, and we laid
under the highest obligations to love him, as being constrained
hereunto by his love, expressed to us in washing
us from our sins in his own blood.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When we pray to be kept from temptation, or recovered,
when fallen by it, we consider ourselves as the subjects of
Christ’s kingdom, and his enemies as endeavouring to draw us
aside from our allegiance to him; and, as dreading the consequence
thereof, we address ourselves to him, to secure us from
the danger we are exposed to from them; and accordingly,
when we say, <i>Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory</i>,
we are furnished with arguments adapted to our present exigencies,
<i>q. d.</i> “The power of our spiritual enemies is great,
and much more formidable, because of the treachery of our
own hearts; yet we are encouraged to implore thine assistance
against them, O our God and King, that we may be
kept in the hour of temptation; inasmuch as all the attempts
that are made against us, carry in them an invasion on thy
sovereignty and dominion over us. We desire always to
commit ourselves to thy protection, and hope to find it, since
there are no snares laid for us, but thou art able to detect
and prevent our being entangled by them, and also canst
bruise our enemies under our feet, and, if we are at any
time overcome by them, recover us from the paths of the
destroyer: Do this for us, we beseech thee, that thou mayest
have all the glory: We have no might, but our eyes are upon
thee, who art able to keep us from falling, and to present us
faultless, before the presence of thy glory, with exceeding
joy.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>As for the word, <i>Amen</i>, with which our Saviour concludes
this prayer, it is of an Hebrew original, and is sometimes prefixed
to what is asserted with a vehemency of expression, designed
not only to confirm, but to bespeak the utmost attention
to what is said, as being a matter of very great importance;
in which case it is rendered by the word <i>verily</i>. And it is
sometimes repeated to add greater force to it: Thus when our
Saviour asserts the necessity of regeneration, he says, <i>Verily,
verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot
see the kingdom of God</i>, John iii. 3. And elsewhere, <i>Verily,
verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in
my name, he will give it you</i>, chap. xvi. 23.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c012'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is put in the close of each of the evangelists, as denoting,
that whatever is contained therein, is to be depended on, as
being of infallible verity; and almost all the epistles are concluded
with it, as is also the book of the Revelation, in which
it is put after a short prayer or doxology; in which respect it
signifies, that what is therein requested of God, is earnestly
desired, and the petition summed up, and ratified thereby; or,
that the glory which is ascribed, is again acknowledged to
belong to him, and we rejoice in the discovery that is made
thereof to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, sometimes the word is not only used, but explained
at the same time, as containing a summary account of what
we ask for: Thus when Benaiah preferred a petition to David
in the behalf of Solomon, and had a grant from him, that he
should reign in his stead; it is said, <i>He answered the king,
and said, Amen; the Lord God of my lord the king say so too</i>,
1 Kings i. 36.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus then the word, <i>Amen</i>, with which this and other prayers
are to be concluded, signifies, <i>so it is, let it be so</i>, or, <i>so it
shall be</i>; each of which respective significations are to be applied
to the subject-matter of our prayers: As it respects sins
confessed, or the glory that we ascribe to God for mercies received,
it denotes, <i>so it is</i>: As it refers to the promises which
we plead and take encouragement from, or the blessings which
we desire, it signifies, <i>so it shall be</i>, and <i>so let it be</i>. Thus it is
to be applied in this prayer; and in particular, as it is joined
to the doxology, <i>Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory,
for ever and ever</i>, we express our faith herein, together with
our adoration of these divine perfections. And there are some
prayers or doxologies, in which the glory of Christ and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>gospel-state is described, which are concluded with the repetition
of the word: Thus when the Psalmist had been enlarging
on this subject, he concludes with, <i>Blessed be his glorious name
for ever; and let the whole earth be filled with his glory, Amen
and Amen</i>, i. e. God has determined that it shall be so, and the
whole church is obliged to express their faith, and say, <i>Amen,
so let it be</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some have thought it expedient in joint prayer, for the
whole assembly, together with him that is the mouth thereof,
to say, <i>Amen</i>, with a loud voice, and thereby to signify their
consent to, and concern in the subject-matter contained therein;
which appears to have been the practice of the church in
the early ages thereof; as Justin Martyr observes it was in
his time<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c012'><sup>[128]</sup></a>; and it was afterwards observed in Jerom’s time,
who compares the sound they made with their united voices to
that of thunder<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c012'><sup>[129]</sup></a>; which, though it was done with a pious design,
and not in the least to be blamed, yet it is not to be insisted
on as necessary, since all present professedly join in
every part of the prayer, as much as though they repeated the
words with an audible voice; and accordingly it is sufficient
for every one, when prayer is publicly concluded with this comprehensive
word, to lift up his heart to God, and thereby express
the part he bears therein.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the contrary extreme, when one, whose office was
altogether unknown to the primitive churches, is appointed to
say, <i>Amen</i>, in the name of the whole congregation; this is, I
think, altogether unwarrantable; though several Popish commentators
defend it from the apostle’s words, who speaks of
him that <i>occupieth the room of the unlearned</i>, as <i>saying, Amen,
at the giving of thanks</i>, 1 Cor. xiv. 16. where, by the unlearned,
we are not to understand the Clerk of a congregation<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c012'><sup>[130]</sup></a>,
but one who understands not the subject-matter of that prayer,
which the apostle supposes to be put to God in an unknown
tongue: All therefore that can be inferred from hence is, that
we ought to pray to God with understanding and faith, that
hereby we may be able to sum up our requests and glorify him
by saying, <i>Amen</i>.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>Theological Questions.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><i>Many theological instructors teach their pupils successfully, by
requiring them, besides the usual course of systematical reading,
interrogative examinations, and critical study of the
scriptures in the original languages, also to write disquisitions
on a number of Questions in Theology. Hereby they
are provided with a store of arguments, on the most difficult
subjects, and furnished with the mature advices of their preceptors;
to which they may recur in any period of after life.

</div>
<p class='c005'><i>THE REV. DR. JOHN GILL’S COMMENTARY</i>.</p>
<p class='c005'>The <span class='sc'>Old Testament</span> is now in the press, and the first volume expected out
in the month of May. To subscribers the price will be 6 dollars per vol. sheep;
$7 in calf; and $5 25 per vol. in boards. On subscribing, the New Testament
can be delivered in 3 volumes, being already printed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following is taken from the Minutes of the Philadelphia Baptist Association—October,
1815.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oct. 18.—This association have heard with pleasure, by a communication
from Mr. Woodward, of his intention to publish Dr. Gill’s Exposition of the Old
Testament, in six large quarto volumes; one of which he hopes, if life and health
be spared, to issue every 4 or 5 months, at the price originally proposed; that
is, $5,25 each vol. in boards—6 in sheep, and 7 in calf. Resolved that this
association recommend to the churches, and the brethren of our denomination
generally, the encouragement of the work, and that each church subscribe at
least for a copy for its respective minister for the time being, and communicate
the result of their subscriptions to Mr. Woodward, as early as possible. He
hopes to issue the first volume in the Spring. Sister associations throughout the
union are affectionately invited to patronize the publication, and should their
piety and wisdom approve of the measure, recommend the adoption of a plan
in their churches generally similar to what is above recommended.”</p>
<p class='c005'><i>SCOTT’S FAMILY BIBLE.</i></p>
<p class='c005'>W. W. Woodward is preparing for the press, in 3 vols. quarto, the Rev. Dr.
<span class='sc'>Scott’s Family Bible</span>, on a new arrangement. The work will contain every
article, except the Marginal References; and the Notes will follow immediately
after the verses to which they belong, and the Practical Observations at the end
of each chapter. The first volume will be published as speedily as possible.—The
flattering encouragement already received, induces the publisher to put to
press a large edition. A copy-right is secured for this popular plan. Price in
boards 18 dolls. 75 cents, bound 21 dolls. Proposals shall be sent to any persons
who will interest themselves in the work—one copy for every five subscribed
for. The Royal Octavo Bible, recently printed by W. W. W. contains all the
Marginal References, all the Introductions to the Books, and also to the Chapters,
with the General Preface, for $5, common, and $5 50, fine paper; plates
added, $1 50; David’s Psalms, or Watts’s imitation, 50 cents; Concordance,
25 cents. It may be had with or without the above; with them separately, or all
bound in one, or two volumes: one dollar advance, if bound in two volumes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <span class='sc'>First Volume</span> will be out in the Spring, and the other volumes as
early after as practicable—this plan is exceedingly popular. The following is
an extract of a letter from a respectable clergyman:—viz. “I am happy to inform
you, your edition, on the new plan, meets the general approbation. Of this
you will be convinced, when I tell you, that in obtaining <i>two hundred subscribers</i>,
I have done little else than to follow along after Proposals for other editions of
the same work. About 40 sets of the above are to be bound in calf.—Many have
subscribed for <i>this</i>, who have absolutely refused to subscribe for <i>others</i>. I think
you may safely conclude, therefore, that many families will be blessed with this
excellent work, who would, perhaps, have ever remained destitute, had it not
been for <i>this edition</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Theatre is said to have commenced at Athens, but to have been so much
disapproved of, both in Greece and at Rome, that it was allowed no permanency
till the days of Pompey. Minutius Felix derided the Christians for abstaining
from this amusement. It is not probable therefore that the first Christians
required any reproof in any of the Epistles for this vice. But every abuse of it
may find its correction in scripture. Morals and piety may be thrown into Dialogue
without reasonable objection. But to turn these things into play, and the
amusement of the reprobate, cannot be justified.—There is no fairness in arguing
from what they might be, to prove the lawfulness of plays in the state in
which they are, always have been, and will probably always be. That they are,
and tend to evil is proved by the avidity with which they are frequented by even
the worst members of society. They are calculated to excite the affections and
passions in the highest manner, and so to render private happiness, domestic enjoyments,
and religious observances insipid or disgusting. The reiteration of
scenes of impurity, illicit amours, extravagant passions, jealousy, and revenge,
will make a silent and secret impression upon the mind, and if they do not promote
the same wickedness, they will at least render the mind less abhorrent of
such crimes. True religion requires the exclusion of such imaginations, the immediate
banishment of such thoughts, that we should mortify and deny ourselves;
“<i>Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.</i>” The cruelty and
bloodshed frequently threatened, or resorted to in defence of false honour; the
pomp, pride, and ambition not unfrequently exhibited upon the stage, must necessarily
prompt to like feats in vindication of character, or at least lead to self-importance
and fastidiousness; but the gospel teaches humility, self-denial,
lowliness of mind; “<i>Blessed are the poor in spirit.</i>” When such representations
please, they prove the mind corrupt, and become an index of the morals of those
who are entertained with such spectacles. The Christian duties of meekness, silence,
forbearance, humility, bearing the cross, faith, and repentance, are either
incapable of being transferred to the stage, or if seen there are exposed to contempt,
and ridicule. The addresses to Deity, and prayers there offered, are surely
Heaven-provoking blasphemies. The Theatre interrupts religious, domestic,
and public duties; it dissipates and fascinates the mind; weakens conscience,
grieves the Holy Spirit, wastes property, and time; and unqualifies both for
this, and the world to come.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every one who attends is chargeable with the evil which obtains before him,
for he goes voluntarily, he submits himself as to the matter of his amusement to
others, and thus with the blessings of Providence, bribes the enemies of God to
blaspheme him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some men of character for morals have countenanced, and some have written
for the stage, perhaps they calculated upon what it might be, and aimed to correct
the evil by drawing to it the more respectable of society. But the great majority
of men are enemies to God, these will only be pleased with evil, and their
pleasure will always be sought, because interest will compel to this. This is
therefore doing evil that good may come; if indeed it can under any circumstances
be good, to turn even correct performances, if such there were, into publick
amusement.</p>

<p class='c006'>After all there can be no hope of a total removal of this evil, yet we are on
this account no more excused from bearing testimony against it, than from opposing
other crimes which cannot be wholly prevented.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r20'>20</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To affect to honour the mercy of God, by supposing this is sufficient
for all our sins, however persevered in, is to disparage his truth which has proposed
terms of mercy, connected our salvation with them, and pronounced them
exclusive. It is to imagine that Deity shall change his purposes; it is an affront
to his wisdom to suppose that after he has placed us in a state of probation and
made us accountable, no retribution should be made. It indicates insincerity,
and not a real regard for the divine glory, to set up such a substitute for the
gospel scheme of salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>To excuse sin by alleging our impotency to good, is disingenuous; because
the party can be conscious of no obstacle, unless his own inclinations to evil can
be so denominated. This excuse casts the blame on God. To persist in sin
under such pretences, is <i>to do evil that good may come</i>, which, the Apostle of the
Gentiles declares renders condemnation just; it is to sin <i>that grace may abound</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>To defer the acceptation of offered mercy, and put off the work of repentance,
is unwise, as it is heaping sorrows against the day of bitterness; it is imprudent,
because it is to remain at enmity with Him upon whom we depend, and to be
liable at every moment of this uncertain life to be involved in everlasting despair.
It is evidence of a very sordid mind to prefer the base gratifications of the
senses, to the refined pleasures of virtue, and the beauty, peace, and comforts of
holiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the procrastination proceed from a dread of the labour of acquiring the
knowledge of the truth, this will be increased by every hour’s delay, as the mind
becomes thereby the less susceptible of religious impressions. The time in
which the work should be accomplished also becomes the shorter; like a traveler,
who has mistaken his course, the impenitent has every step to tread back again,
and his time is proportionally curtailed. The truths of natural science flatter
our pride and ambition, but those of religion humble and crucify them; the
latter, being opposed to the carnal mind, disgust; if such disgust produce a delay
of conversion, the truths which have once excited such aversion will be more
likely afterwards to do it, because the mind by once having rejected them has
become more sensual, and opposed to moral good.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cares and business of life not merely pre-occupy the mind, and exclude
the thoughts of religion, but augment our addictedness to earthly objects, and
render progressively the mind more insensible to lessons of piety. In old age
avarice or sensuality are often at the highest pitch; the man has become more
impatient and irritable, tenacious even of his errours, and averse to changes, no
change can be looked for but the great one, when the messenger arrives, who
brings a scythe in his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>To defer conversion till death, that its terrors may dissolve the charms of the
world, besides the hazard of surprise, is unreasonable, as it supposes mercy
when we have persisted in rebellion as long as we can; it is to expect that God’s
Spirit shrill always strive with man; it is highly presumptuous; and it exposes
also to self-deception, as religion in that late hour must be the effect of necessity,
and destitute of the fruits and proofs of holiness.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r21'>21</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I come now to say somewhat of the antiquity of Musical Instruments.
But that these were not used in the Christian Church in the primitive times, is
attested by all the ancient writers with one consent. Hence they figuratively
explain all the places of the Old Testament, which speak of Musical Instruments;
as I might easily shew by a thousand testimonies, out of <i>Clement</i> of
<i>Alexandria</i>, <i>Basil</i>, <i>Ambrose</i>, <i>Jerom</i>, <i>Augustine</i>, <i>Chrysostom</i>, and many others. I
can hardly forbear laughing, when I meet with some of their allegorical interpretations.
Thus an Instrument with ten strings, according to them, signifies
the Ten Commandments, as the unknown author of the Commentary upon the
<i>Psalms</i>, among <i>Jerom’s</i> works, often explains it, <i>In</i> Ps. xxxii. 2. xliii. 4, &amp;c. But
the pleasantest fancy is the explication of those words: <i>Praise him with stringed
Instruments and Organs</i>. Ps. cl. 4. “That the guts being twisted by reason of
abstinence from food, and so all carnal desires being subdued, men are found
fit for the kingdom of God, to sing his praises.” But <i>Chrysostom</i> talks more
handsomly; “As the <i>Jews</i> praised God with all kind of Instruments; so we are
commanded to praise him with all the members of our bodies, our eyes, <i>&amp;c.</i>”
<i>In</i> Ps. cl. And <i>Clement</i> of <i>Alexandria</i> talks much to the same purpose. Pædag.
<i>lib. ii. c. 4</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides, the ancients thought it unlawful to use those Instruments in God’s
worship. Thus the unknown author of a Treatise, among <i>Justin Martyr’s</i> works:
“<i>Q.</i> If songs were invented by unbelievers with a design of deceiving, and were
appointed for those under the Law, because of the childishness of their minds;
why do they, who have received the perfect instructions of grace, which are
most contrary to the foresaid customs, nevertheless sing in the Churches, just
as they did, who were children under the Law? <i>Answ.</i> Plain Singing is not
childish, but only the Singing with lifeless Organs, with Dancing and Cym-bals,
<i>&amp;c.</i> Whence the use of such Instruments, and other things fit for
children, is laid aside, and Plain Singing only retained.” Resp. ad Orthodox.
<i>Q.</i> 107.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Chrysostom</i> seems to have been of the same mind, and to have thought, the
use of such Instruments was rather allowed the <i>Jews</i> in consideration of their
weakness, than prescribed and commanded. <i>In</i> Ps. cl. But that he was mistaken,
and that Musical Instruments were not only allowed the <i>Jews</i>, as he thought,
and <i>Isidorus</i> of <i>Pelusium</i>, (whose testimony I shall mention presently) but were
prescribed by God, may appear from the Texts of Scripture I have before referred
to.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Clement</i>, as I have mentioned already, thought these things fitter for beasts,
than for men. And though <i>Basil</i> highly commends, and stifly defends the way
of Singing by turns; yet he thought musical Instruments unprofitable and hurtful.
He calls them, <i>the inventions of</i> Jubal <i>of the race of</i> Cain. And a little after,
he thus expresses himself: “<i>Laban</i> was a lover of the harp, and of music, with
which he would have sent away <i>Jacob</i>: <i>If thou hadst told me</i>, said he, <i>I would
have sent thee away with mirth, and musical instruments, and an Harp</i>. But the
Patriarch avoided that music, as being a thing that would hinder his regarding
the works of the Lord, and his considering the works of his hands.” Comment.
in Is. <i>c.</i> v. <i>p.</i> 956, 957. And a little before, he says thus “In such vain
arts, as the playing upon the Harp, or Pipe, or dancing, as soon as the action
ceases, the work itself vanishes. So that really, according to the Apostle’s expression,
<i>The end of these things is destruction</i>.” <i>page</i> 955.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Isidore</i> of <i>Pelusium</i>, who lived since <i>Basil</i>, held, music was allowed the <i>Jews</i>
by God, in a way of condescension to their childishness: “If God” <i>says he</i>, “bore
with bloody sacrifices, because of men’s childishness at that time; why should
you wonder, he bore with the music of an harp and a psaltery?” Epist. lib.
2. <i>ep.</i> 176.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nay, there are some ecclesiastical officers in the Church of <i>England</i>, who, for
their very profession and employment, would have been kept from the communion
of the Church, except they desisted from it. So we are informed by the
<i>Apostolical Constitutions</i>: “If any come to the mystery of godliness, being a
player upon a pipe, a lute, or an harp; let him leave it off, or be rejected.”
<i>Lib.</i> viii. <i>c.</i> 32.</p>

<p class='c006'>From what has been said, it appears, no musical instruments were used in
the pure times of the Church. It became Antichristian, before they were received.
<i>Bellarmine</i> himself does not deny, they were late brought into the
Church. “The second ceremony,” <i>says he</i>, “are the Musical Instruments, which
began to be used in the service of the Church, in the time of Pope <i>Vitalian</i>,
about the year 660, as <i>Platina</i> relates out of the <i>Pontifical</i>; or, as <i>Aimonius</i>
rather thinks, <i>lib.</i> iv. <i>De gestis Francorum</i>, <i>c.</i> 114. after the year 820, in the
time or <i>Lewis</i> the Pious.” De Missa, <i>lib.</i> ii. <i>c.</i> 15. Item, De bon. Oper. <i>lib.</i> i. c. 17.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. <i>N.</i> would hardly have denied, the Church of <i>Rome</i> was become Antichristian,
when they were first brought in; even though we should allow <i>Bellarmine’s</i>
first date of them to be the true one. But a Reformed Divine may well be ashamed
of that antiquity, that does not exceed the rise of Antichrist. But I
am fully satisfied both <i>Bellarmine’s</i> dates are false, and that instrumental music,
in the worship of God, is much later than either of those accounts allow. For
as to <i>Platina</i>, he seems to suspect the truth of what he wrote: “<i>Vitalian</i>,” <i>says
he</i>, “being careful about the worship of God, made an ecclesiastical rule, and
ordered the singing, with the addition (as some think) of organs.” In Vital.
Again, <i>Bellarmine’s Aimonius</i> is not the true <i>Aimonius</i>. For (as Dr. <i>Cave</i> says)
<i>Aimonius of Fleury</i>, who wrote, <i>De gestis Francorum</i>, flourished about the year
1000; and his History, which begins at the destruction of <i>Troy</i>, is brought down
as far as the coronation of King <i>Pipin</i>, or to the year 752. For what comes after
that, and makes up the fifth book, and the latter part of the fourth, is the continuation
of another hand. Hist. Liter. <i>p.</i> 597.</p>

<p class='c006'>Farther, that these instruments were not used in God’s worship, in <i>Thomas
Aquinas’s</i> time, that is, about the year 1250, he himself is witness. “In the old
Law,” <i>says he</i>, “God was praised both with musical instruments and human voices,
and according to that <i>Psalm</i> xxxiii. <i>Praise the Lord with harp, sing unto
him with the psaltery, and an instrument of ten strings.</i> But the Church does not
use musical instruments to praise God, lest she should seem to judaize.
Therefore, by parity of reason, she should not use singing.” Secunda secundæ
Questio 91, <i>art.</i> 4. &amp; <i>conclus.</i> 4. The like objection is made by our author. But
<i>Thomas</i> answers: “As to this objection, we must say, as the philosopher, <i>Lib.</i>
viii. <i>Polit.</i> that Pipes are not to be used for teaching, nor any artificial instruments,
as the harp, or the like: but whatever will make the hearers good men.
For these musical instruments rather delight the mind, than form it to any
good disposition. But under the Old Testament such instruments were used,
partly because the people were harder and more carnal; upon which account
they were to be stirred up by these instruments, as likewise by earthly promises;
and partly because these bodily instruments were typical of something.”
Upon which place Cardinal <i>Cajetan</i> gives us this Comment: “’Tis
to be observed, the Church did not use organs in <i>Thomas’s</i> time. Whence,
even to this day, the Church of <i>Rome</i> does not use them in the Pope’s presence.
And truly it will appear, that musical instruments are not to be suffered
in the ecclesiastical offices we meet together to perform, for the sake of
receiving internal instruction from God; and so much the rather are they to
be excluded, because God’s internal discipline exceeds all human disciplines,
which rejected these kind of instruments.” <i>Cit.</i> Hoffm. Lex. voce <i>Musica</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>If any one objects the practice of some foreign churches, I answer with Mr.
<i>Hickman</i>: “They are laid aside by most of the reformed churches; nor would
they be retained among the <i>Lutherans</i>, unless they had forsaken their own
<i>Luther</i>; who, by the confession of Eckard, reckoned <i>organs among the ensigns
of Baal</i>. That they still continue in some of the <i>Dutch</i> churches, is against
the minds of the Pastors. For in the National Synod at <i>Middleburg</i>, in the
year 1581, and in the Synod of <i>Holland</i> and <i>Zealand</i>, in the year 1594, it was
resolved, <i>That they would endeavour to obtain of the magistrate the laying aside
of organs, and the singing with them in the churches, even out of the time of worship,
either before or after sermons</i>: so far are those Synods from bearing with
them in the worship itself.” <i>Apol. p.</i> 139.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Church of <i>England</i> herself had formerly no very good opinion of these
musical instruments; as may appear by her Homilies: “Lastly, God’s vengeance
hath been, and is daily provoked, because much wicked people pass
nothing to resort unto the church; either for that they are so sore blinded,
that they understand nothing of God or godliness, and care not with devilish
malice to offend their neighbours; or else for that they see the church altogether
scoured of such gay gazing sights, as their gross phantasie was greatly
delighted with; because they see the false religion abandoned, and the true
restored, which seemeth an unsavory thing to their unsavory taste, as may
appear by this that a woman said to her neighbour: Alas! gossip, what shall
we now do at church, since all the Saints are taken away; since all the goodly
sights we were wont to have are gone; since we cannot hear the like piping,
singing, Chaunting, and playing upon the organs that we could before? But,
dearly beloved, we ought greatly to rejoice and give God thanks, that our
churches are delivered out of all those things, which displeased God so sore,
and filthily defiled his holy house, and his place of prayer.” Hom. of the place
and time of prayer, <i>part.</i> 2. p. 131.</p>

<p class='c006'>A great number also of the Clergy in the first convocation of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>
in 1562, earnestly laboured to have organs, and that pompous theatrical way of
singing laid aside, and missed the carrying it but by one vote, as I observe elsewhere.
And in this Archbishop <i>Parker</i> concurred with them, or at least did not
oppose them.</p>

<p class='c006'>I will add one or two testimonies of Papists against this cathedral way of
worship. The first shall be <i>Polydorus Virgilius</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having taken notice of <i>Austine’s</i> dislike of that way of singing in his time, he
thus proceeds: “But in our time, it seems much less useful to the commonwealth,
now our singers make such a noise in our churches, that nothing can
be heard, beside the sound of the voice; and they who come there (that is all
that are in the city) are satisfied with the concert of music, which their ears
itch for, and never mind the sense of the words. So that we are come to that pass,
that in the opinion of the common people, the whole affair of religious worship
is lodged in these singers; although, generally speaking, there is no sort of
men more loose or wicked: and yet a good part of the people run to church,
as to a theatre, to hear them bawl: they hire and encourage them; and look
upon them alone as ornaments to the house of God. Wherefore, without
doubt, it would be for the interest of religion, either to cast these jackdaws
out of the churches; or else to teach them when they sing, they should do it
rather in the manner of reading, than bawling; as <i>Austine</i> says <i>Athanasius</i>
ordered, <i>&amp;c.</i>” De Invent. Rer. <i>lib.</i> vi. <i>c.</i> 2. <i>p.</i> 379.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next hear the judgment of <i>Erasmus</i>: “Let a man be more covetous than
<i>Crassus</i>, more foul-mouthed than <i>Zoilus</i>, he shall be reckoned a pious man, if
he sings those prayers well, though he understands nothing of them. But
what, I beseech you, must they think of Christ, who can believe he is delighted
with such a noise of men’s voices? Not content with this, we have brought
into our churches a certain operose and theatrical music; such a confused disorderly
chattering of some words, as I hardly think was ever heard in any of
the <i>Grecian</i> or <i>Roman</i> theatres. The church rings with the noise of trumpets,
pipes and dulcimers; and human voices strive to bear their part with them.—Men
run to church as to a theatre, to have their ears tickled. And for this
end organ-makers are hired with great salaries, and a company of boys, who
waste all their time in learning these whining tones. Pray now compute how
many poor people in great extremity might be maintained by the salaries of
those singers.” In 1 Cor. xiv. 19.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lastly, <i>Lindanus</i> says: “Who will compare the Music of this present age,
with that which was formerly used? Whatever is sung now, signifies little for
informing the people; which ’tis certain the ancients always designed.”

by those, who have been episcopally vested with holy orders.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a matter of such momentous concern, they would not have acted an unworthy
part, if they had confined their pleas to the sacred writings; producing
such passages from them as speak to the point, not implicitly and darkly; but
in peremptory and express terms, so as to leave no reasonable room for hesitation
or doubt. It would be dishonourary to the <span class='fss'>BIBLE</span>, and a gross reflection on
the penman of it, to call that an “appointment of Christ,” and an “essentially
necessary” one, which is not contained in this sacred volume, and with such
clearness and precision, that sober and impartial inquirers may readily perceive
it to be there, without foreign help to assist their sight. And yet, such help is
made necessary by episcopal writers. They scarce ever fail of turning us to the
<span class='fss'>FATHERS</span> in vindication of their cause; hereby virtually reflecting disgrace on
the scriptures, as though they were insufficient, simply of themselves, to bring
this controversy to an issue.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to reconcile the appeal that is so often made to the <span class='fss'>FATHERS</span> with
that honour which is due to the scriptures, the episcopalian plea is, that they
consider these fathers, not as <i>judges</i>, but <i>witnesses</i> only in their cause. But
what are they brought to witness? Is it, that episcopacy is an institution of
Jesus Christ? If this is witnessed to in the sacred books, of which we, having
these in our hands, are as good judges as they, it is sufficient. There is no
need of any foreign testimony. If it is not, no other testimony can supply this
defect. Are these fathers cited as witnesses to what was the practice in their
day? This is now generally the pretence. They may, say the episcopalians,
be properly appealed to, in order to know the truth of <span class='fss'>FACT</span> in the ages in which
they lived. And if, from their unanimous testimony, even from the first days
of Christianity, it appears, that <span class='fss'>GOVERNING</span> and ordaining <span class='fss'>AUTHORITY</span> was exercised
by Bishops <span class='fss'>ONLY</span>, in distinction from Presbyters, and as an order in the
church above them, it would argue great arrogance, if not obstinate perverseness,
to dispute the divine original of episcopacy. But we must be excused,
however perverse we may be accounted, if we cannot bring ourselves to think,
that the practice of the church, since the apostles’ days, however universal, will
justify our receiving that as an institution of Christ, and an essentially important
one, which he himself hath not clearly and evidently made so, either in his
own person, or by those inspired writers, whom he commissioned and instructed
to declare his will: nor can we believe the great Author of christianity would
have put the professors of it to the difficult, I may say, as to most of them, the
impossible task of collecting any thing essential to their salvation from the voluminous
records of antiquity. We are rather persuaded, he has ordered every
article that is necessary, either in point of faith or practice, to be so fairly and
legibly wrote by the sacred penman, as that there should be no need of having
recourse to the ancient Fathers as <span class='fss'>WITNESSES</span>, any more than judges, to ascertain
his mind. To suppose the contrary, would, in reality of construction, substitute
<span class='fss'>TRADITION</span> the rule of essential truth, in the room of the <span class='fss'>SCRIPTURES</span>,
which were “given by inspiration of God;” or, at least make the former so
much a part of this rule, as that the latter, without it, would not be sufficiently
complete. Such dishonour ought not to be cast on the one only standard of the
real mind of Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Bishop, in whose defence an appeal is made to antiquity, is not related,
by his office, to a single congregation of christians only, with one or more Presbyters
belonging to it; but his charge is a diocess, consisting of a number of
congregations, greater or less, with their respective Presbyters. The inquiry
therefore is, whether it be an <span class='fss'>UNIVERSALLY ATTESTED FACT</span>, that episcopacy, in
this sense, took place in, and through, the two first ages? A Bishop, at the head of
a number of congregations, greater or less, is an officer in the church of Christ
quite different from the pastor of a single congregation; though he should be
called Bishop, as being the <span class='sc'>Head-Presbyter</span>, or vested with the character of
<span class='fss'>PRIMUS INTER PARES</span>. It should be particularly noted, which of these kinds of
episcopacy has the voice of the specified antiquity in its favour. It is willingly
left with every man of common understanding, after he has gone over the following
testimonies, to say, whether he thinks, that Bishops, after the <span class='fss'>DIOCESAN-MODE</span>,
were known in the first ages of the church?</p>

<p class='c006'>The Bishop, for whom the fathers are called in as <span class='fss'>WITNESSES</span>, is an officer in
the church of an <span class='fss'>ORDER SUPERIOR</span> to that of Presbyters, and as distinct from it
as the order of Presbyters is from that of Deacons; the pretence being this,
that Presbyters were thought to have, in primitive times, no more right to meddle
with the peculiar work of Bishops, than Deacons have to concern themselves
with the peculiar work of Presbyters. The question therefore is, Whether it
will appear from the following evidence, to be at all a <span class='fss'>FACT</span>, much less an <span class='fss'>UNIVERSALLY</span>
known, and certainly attested one, that there were Bishops, in this
sense, in any church, in any part of the christian world, within the two first
centuries?</p>

<p class='c006'>The Bishop, in whose favour the ancient Fathers are said universally to speak,
is one to whom the <span class='fss'>EXCLUSIVE RIGHT OF GOVERNMENT</span> has been committed by
the appointment of Jesus Christ, or his apostles as commissioned by him. Says
the famous Bishop Hoadly, treating of the government of the church, as belonging
to Bishops only, in the above appropriated sense, “And here—I think I
may say, that we have as universal and as unanimous a testimony of all
writers, and historians from the apostles’ days, as could reasonably be expected
or desired: every one, who speaks of the government of the church, in
any place, witnessing, that episcopacy was the settled form; and every one,
who hath occasion to speak of the original of it, tracing it up to the apostles’
days, and fixing it upon their decree.—Were there only testimonies to be produced,
that this was the government of the church in all ages, it would be but
reasonable to conclude it of apostolical institution;—but when we find the
same persons witnessing, not only that it was episcopal, but that it was of
apostolical institution, and delivered down from the beginning as such, this
adds weight to the matter, and makes it more undoubted. So that here are
two points to which they bear witness, that this was the government of the
church in their days, and that it was of apostolical institution. And in these
there is such a constancy and unanimity, that even St. Jerom himself traces up
episcopacy to the very apostles, and makes it of their institution.”—He adds,
“All churches and christians, as far as we know, seem to have been agreed, in
this point, amidst all their other differences, as universally as can well be imagined.”
One would suppose, from the peremptory manner in which this citation
is expressed, that the <span class='fss'>FACT</span> it affirms was so evidently clear, as to leave
no room for the least doubt. Those, who may think it worth while to look
over the <i>testimonies</i> brought to view, in the following pages, will perhaps, by critically
observing their real and just import, be surprized, that any man of learning,
who professes a regard to truth, should speak of it, and with such a degree
of assurance, as the <span class='fss'>UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF ALL AGES</span> from the apostles, that
episcopacy, in the impleaded sense, was the “form of government in the church
in their day,” and that it was by “apostolical institution;” especially, if they
should not be able to find, as it is certain they will not, so much as a single witness,
for two hundred years, whose evidence is clear, direct, express, and full, in
affirming, either that this was the form of government in the church, or that it
was ever instituted by Christ, or his apostles: so far is it from the truth, that
this is a <span class='fss'>FACT UNANIMOUSLY</span> and <span class='fss'>CONSTANTLY TESTIFIED TO</span>, even from the beginning,
and through all ages.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Bishop, for the support of whose claims antiquity is repaired to, is one
with whom the <span class='fss'>SOLE POWER</span> of <span class='fss'>ORDINATION</span> is lodged; insomuch, that he only
can convey holy orders conformably to the appointment of Jesus Christ; and
should Presbyters presume to do this, they would take that upon them which
they have no more a right to, than Deacons have to baptise, or administer the
Lord’s supper. This part of the <span class='fss'>UNANIMOUS</span> report of <span class='fss'>ALL AGES</span> concerning
the <span class='fss'>EXCLUSIVE RIGHT</span> of Bishops deserves most of all the special notice of
the reader; and he is particularly desired, as he goes along, to point out to
himself, for his own satisfaction; or to others, for their information, any one
among all the testimonies he will have placed before his view, that plainly and
directly affirms the <span class='fss'>RIGHT OF ORDINATION</span> to be peculiar to Bishops as a distinct
order from Presbyters, and superior to them; or that this right was ever
thus exercised by them. If he should not be able to do this, as unquestionably
he will not, how strange must that affirmation appear, which says in the most
positive terms, not only that this is <span class='fss'>FACT</span>, but a fact <span class='fss'>CONSTANTLY</span> and <span class='fss'>UNANIMOUSLY</span>
witnessed to by the fathers, in <span class='fss'>ALL AGES</span> from the days of the apostles.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Bishop, in whose defence antiquity is pleaded, is vested with the power
of <span class='fss'>CONFIRMATION</span>, according to the mode of the church of England; and it is
appropriated to him as his right in distinction from all others. But I need not
assure the reader, he will in vain look to find it a <span class='fss'>FACT</span>, within the two first ages,
that Bishops were either vested with, or ever exercised this power. For he
must come down below these ages, before a word is said, by any one of the
fathers, relative to this superstitious practice. Tertullian is the first that mentions
it; and he mentions likewise some other corruptions, which had got
mingled with christianity in that day.</p>

<p class='c006'>In short, the question in debate, so far as it relates to <span class='fss'>FACT</span>, is, not whether
there were officers in the christian church, known by the name of Bishops in the
apostolic age, and down along through the two first centuries? We join with
the episcopalians in affirming this to be a truth universally testified to in those
times: but the proper question is, what is <span class='fss'>FACT</span> with reference to the <span class='fss'>ORDER</span> of
these Bishops, and the <span class='fss'>POWERS PECULIAR TO THEIR OFFICE</span>, and as <span class='fss'>EXERCISED</span> by
them in it? The name of Bishop is one thing, and the <span class='fss'>POWER</span> claimed for, or
exercised by him, is another. The dispute is, not about the name, but the
power appropriated to it. This therefore should be heedfully attended to by
all, in their examination of the evidences that will be produced; and they may,
in this way, clearly and satisfactorily determine, each one for himself, whether it
be at all an attested <span class='fss'>FACT</span>, much less a <span class='fss'>CONSTANT</span> and <span class='fss'>UNANIMOUSLY ATTESTED
ONE</span>, from the apostles days, and down along through the two first ages, as
well as after ones, that Bishops were vested with, and did actually exercise, the
above specified powers, which are at this day claimed for them, as the appropriate
work of their office by divine appointment?</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r59'>59</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Βαπτιζω, has been said to signify immergo and <i>exclusively</i> when applied
to sacred baptism. And this is necessary to establish immersion as the only
mode. The question is not, therefore, whether Βαπτιζω, sometimes signifies to
immerse, but <i>whether it never signifies any thing else</i>. This can be proved, it is
presumed, by no Lexicographer, and no version of the New Testament. In the
New Testament it is taken in different senses, for example we read of a Baptism
with <i>the Holy Ghost and with fire</i>. It is therefore a <i>generic</i> term and not <i>specific</i>,
as <i>immerse</i> cannot be substituted for it in all places. If a specific Greek term signifying
to <i>plunge</i> had occasionally been used for it, in the New Testament, yet
baptism being in our Saviour’s commission to his disciples, should not have been
confined to one mode, but this is never the case. The numerous admissions of
our divines, that Βαπτιζω, primarily signifies to <i>immerse</i>, and which are disingenuously
collected to impose on the ignorant; do not weaken our cause, as
they did neither influence the practice nor sentiments of those who used them.</p>

<p class='c006'>If Βαπτιζω, signifies to <i>immerse totally</i>, or <i>partially</i>; to dip, to cleanse, or purify,
&amp;c. it leaves the mode to our convenience or choice; and reason also accords,
that the mode is unimportant with respect to moral defilement.—Porphery has
“Βαπτιζεται μεχρι κεφαλης.” The oracle said “Βαπτιζη <i>him as a bottle</i>” (of leather,
which could swim) “<i>but it is not lawful to plunge him wholly under water</i>.” Strabo
says, “Βαπτιζομενων <i>up to the waist</i>.” Aristotle says “Βαπτεικαι ανθιζει τηνχειρα,”
<i>it stains and renders florid the hand</i>. Aristophanes says, “Βαπτομενος Βραχειοις,”
<i>stained with tawny colours</i>. Homer says, “¨Εβαπτετο δ᾽᾽ αιματι λιμνω,” <i>And the fountain
was tinged with blood</i>. Rev. xix. 13. “Ιματων Βεβαμενον αιματι.” Isaiah xxi. 4.

the history of the church and of the world. These words may be considered as
the public and formal abrogation of the Mosaic economy; and the authoritative
annunciation of the new order of things under the gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first communications of divine truth, through Adam and Noah, were made
indiscriminately to the human family; but, in both instances, the precious deposit
was generally adulterated, and nearly lost. The wisdom of God, therefore,
saw it to be necessary to select and separate from the idolatrous world, a particular
family which might serve as a repository of the divine oracles and institutions;
until that ‘<i>Seed of the woman</i>’ should come, of whom it was predicted,
that he should ‘<i>bruise the serpent’s head</i>:’ and that <i>‘seed of Abraham’ in whom
all the families of the earth should be blessed</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>But when <span class='sc'>Jesus Christ</span>, <i>our great high-priest of good things to come, had,
through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, to bear the sins of
many</i>; and had <i>by this one offering of his own body, perfected them that are sanctified</i>,
the service of the first tabernacle was set aside, and as to any utility, or divine
authority, ceased forever; as an emblem of which, the veil of the temple
was rent in twain from the top to the bottom, at the very moment of expiation;
when Christ our high-priest, by sheding his vital blood and pouring out his
soul unto death, <i>offered his one great sacrifice for sins</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>So great, however, was the power of early and national prejudice, that the
apostles did not, for some time, understand the extent of their commission. They
had, before, been sent on a short mission, on which occasion it was ordered, that
they should not go <i>into the way of the Gentiles</i>, nor even <i>enter into any city of the
Samaritans</i>; and they seem to have thought, that by going <i>into all the world</i>, and
<i>preaching to every creature</i>, no more was intended, than that they should go to
the seed of Abraham now widely dispersed among the nations. But this veil was
soon removed, by a particular revelation made to Peter in a vision; and by the
calling of Paul to the apostleship, who, from the beginning, received commission
to go to the Gentiles, and was, in a peculiar manner, designated and directed,
<i>to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r68'>68</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Gospel is glad tidings of great joy, not a system of new and terrifying
restrictions and exclusions; so far from retracting formerly conceded privileges,
and confining the church within narrower limits, it publishes peace and
salvation, and invites the whole human family to participate in these blessings.
It must either be referred to the impressions it has made, or to uninterrupted
usage that females have, by a general consent, been deemed to possess an unquestionable
right to approach the holy communion, though neither precept for
it is found, nor an example of it recorded in the Scriptures. This baptism of
infants was still less necessary to be enjoined by, and less likely to have been noticed
in the short history given us of apostolical transactions.</p>

<p class='c006'>He who gave parental affection, and is the Lord of his church under every
dispensation, conferred on children at an early age of the world the privilege of
sharing with their parents in the seals of grace, and bearing the tokens of his
covenant. Jewish christians having themselves experienced such benignity, and
been given to the same God, whom they now served under brighter displays of
his eternal and unchangeable love, could not have expected, that, an entrance
into the milder gospel-church would have been denied to the seed whom God
had given them, and whom they had devoted to him not only in prayer, but in
that ordinance which he had appointed for the purpose. An ordinance which
being now obsolete was supplied by another, apparently as proper for their
children as themselves. Because infants are incapable of repenting and believing,
these duties were not required nor expected of them, either under the
old, or new dispensation; but though incapable of actual sin, and therefore free
from obligations of obedience unto the law, yet their nature is not pure, and
consequently needs the sanctifying influence of divine grace, which can correct
the latent enmity, and renew the soul. They are capable, therefore, of spiritual
blessings, and may consequently be members of the invisible church, and
received into the church triumphant. The obvious reasonableness of the privilege
of being received with their parents into the society of the worshippers
of God, a privilege publicly known to have been conferred by the great Head of
the church, equally prevented the supposition of an implied repeal, and the necessity
of a renewal of the right.</p>

<p class='c006'>If indeed there had been a different religion introduced; if christians were not
engrafted into the old stock; if they worshipped some other than the God of
Israel; if there was another moral law, another Christ than he whose day the
fathers anticipated, and another faith; this privilege of receiving infants into the
church might have been interrupted; and in that case unless expressly again
enjoined, it ought not to have been regarded in practice. But if the christian
religion is founded upon the prophets; if the peculiarities of the Jewish worship
were but shadows of gospel things; if both were directed to the same glory of
God and salvation of men; if they both enjoined the same holiness and presented
the same object of faith; if those who were saved under the Old Testament shall
be associated with those who are saved under the New; the privileges formerly
granted to children will remain the same; and it is not wonderful that the first
christian should obey the dictates of parental tenderness; and that desiring the
salvation of their children as well as their own, should cause their households to
be baptized as well as themselves. To have affirmed in the gospel history expressly,
that children were a part of the household, could have answered no
purpose in the first days of christianity, but would have been thought repetitions
and unmeaning until modern times. In the fifth, in the third and even so
early as in the second century, the baptism of infants was the established usage
of the church, and it was then thought, and not disputed, to have been the practice
of the apostles themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r71'>71</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This then is a repetition; go, <i>teach</i>, baptize, <i>teach</i>. This commission
was to <i>disciple</i> the world, baptizing and teaching are the specification, and are
participles agreeing with the nomination.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is no inference from the position of baptizing before teaching are that adults
might be first baptized. This was the institution of the ordinance of baptism
as well as the apostolic commission; yet it neither contains any direction
either as to the mode or subjects; because Christ spoke to Jews, who knew that
adult proselytes were carefully examined, whilst infants were circumcised with
their parents without such examination. They also knew the various modes of
religious purifications among the Jews; both John the Baptist, and they having
under that dispensation baptized. Neither is faith essential to the validity
of baptism, nor is the profession of it required of such as are incapable of
making it.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f72'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r72'>72</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To be brought into the visible church, is a high privilege, of which infants
are as capable now, as under the former dispensation. Consent is not necessary;
for infants receive inheritances. <i>This is by force of municipal laws.</i> But
are not the laws of God of equal force?—<i>Baptism implies obligations, which can
be founded only on consent.</i> Then it will follow that infants are not bound by human
laws, for they have not assented to the social compact; they are under no
obligation to obey parents, guardians, or masters, because they either did not
choose them, or were incompetent to make such choice; they are not bound by
the laws of God himself, which is this very case, because they have not consented
to his authority; and if they never consent, they will be always free equally
from all obligations, and all sin. Such are the consequences of the above objection.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f73'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r73'>73</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The dictates of nature, uncontrouled by revelation, are the will of Christ,
and our rule of duty. The <i>will of Christ</i>, expressed in these dictates, requires us to
benefit our children as they are capable. <i>Baptism</i>, as the initiatory seal of God’s
covenant, is a <i>benefit</i> of which infants are <i>capable</i>.—This evidence is not <i>eclipsed</i>,
but <i>brightened</i>, by scripture authority, as we shall see in the sequel of this
chapter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let the reader carefully notice, that we do not suppose, by insisting on this
argument, the insufficiency of <i>direct scripture</i> evidence: for <i>this</i> has been frequently
urged with advantage, to satisfy persons of the best dispositions and abilities.
That is, reader, “some of the most eminent Pœdobaptists that ever filled
the Professor’s chair, or that ever yet adorned the Protestant pulpit.” But
since our opponents insist, that what has been so often urged, is not conclusive;
and <i>modestly</i> affirm, it is only calculated to catch “the eye of a <i>superficial</i> observer;”
they are desired once more impartially to weigh this reasoning, and
then, if they are able, to refute it. Let them know, however, that hackneyed
phrases without meaning—principles taken upon trust—and empty declamation—must
not be palmed on us instead of solid arguments.</p>

<p class='c006'>Were it necessary, it would be easy to shew, that the principles above urged
are no <i>novelty</i>; but are perfectly agreeable to experience,—and to the practical
judgment of the most serious Pœdobaptists, both illiterate and learned. But
waving this, we proceed next to another corroborating proof of the main proposition.</p>

<p class='c006'>What we contend for is. That it is the <i>will of Christ</i> we should <i>baptize</i> our infant
children. In proof of this we have shewn, first, that the <i>dictates of right reason</i>
require us to <i>benefit</i> them, and consequently to <i>baptize</i> them; as baptism is always
a benefit when administered to <i>capable</i> subjects. We come, secondly, to shew—That
God has constantly approved of <i>this principle</i>, in all <i>preceding</i> dispensations.
In other words—That the <i>principle</i> of the last argument is so far from being
<i>weakened</i> by scripture evidence, that the Lord’s <i>approbation</i> of <i>it</i>, in his conduct
towards the offspring of his professing people, in all the dispensations of
true religion, is abundantly <i>illustrated</i> and <i>confirmed</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. B’s misapplied but favourite maxim—“Positive laws imply their negative,”
has no force in the baptismal controversy, until he demonstrates, in opposition
to what is advanced, that the dictates of right reason must be <i>smothered</i>,
or else, that revelation countermands their influence. But to <i>demonstrate</i> the
former, in matters about which, on the supposition, scripture is silent, is no easy
task. And the difficulty will be <i>increased</i> in proportion as the sacred oracles
corroborate reason’s verdict. Let us now appeal to these oracles.</p>

<p class='c006'>We appeal to that period of the church, and dispensation of grace, which extended
from Adam to Noah. The inspired narrative of this long space of time is
very short: on which we make the following remarks. We then assert,</p>

<p class='c006'>Whatever exhibition of grace was made to antediluvian <i>parents</i>, was constantly
made to their <i>offspring</i>; and consequently whatever seals of grace were granted
to the former, must equally appertain to the latter if not voluntary <i>rejectors</i>
of them. Therefore, all such parents had a <i>revealed</i> warrant to regard their offspring
as entitled to the <i>seals</i> of the covenant, in <i>like manner</i> as themselves, according
to their capacity. For,</p>

<p class='c006'>All allow that Gen. iii. 15. contains the promulgation of gospel grace; nor are
we authorised to question the interest of <i>children</i> therein with their parents,
without an express contravention. For, it were <i>unnatural</i> for a parent to <i>confine</i>
such a <i>benefit</i> to his own person to the exclusion of his children, who are not only
parts of his family but of <i>himself</i>. To which we may add, that the phrase <i>thy
seed</i>, though principally referring to the Messiah, respected Eve’s <i>natural seed</i>
as sharers in common with herself in the exhibition of mercy; and we suppose
not less so than her <i>husband</i>. For this application of the phrase <i>thy seed</i>, compare
Gen. xvii. 7. and Gal. iii. 16. Again,</p>

<p class='c006'>It is generally agreed, that not only the institution of <i>sacrifices</i>, but also the
<i>coats</i> of skin, (Gen. iii. 21.) were <i>emblematic</i> of covenant blessings; and not only
so, in common with mere types, but <i>seals</i> of the covenant, as earnests and
pledges of exhibited favour. “Who will deny,” says Witsius, “that God’s
cloathing our first parents was a <i>symbolical</i> act? Do not Christ’s own words
(Rev. iii. 18.) very clearly allude to this?” As for <i>sacrifices</i>, they were slain at
God’s command after the promulgation of the covenant. For, if Abel <i>offered by
faith</i>, (Heb xi. 4.) it presupposes the divine <i>institution</i> of them. And this institution,
most probably, took place when God—taking occasion from the insufficiency
of the aprons of fig-leaves, which the fallen pair sewed together, to cover
the shame of their nakedness—himself cloathed them with coats of skins. And
most divines agree, that it is very probable, these were the skins of those beasts
which were slain for <i>sacrifices</i>. However, God gave testimony to these oblations
of the ancient patriarchs, that they were <i>acceptable</i> to him; but this cannot be
supposed without admitting them to be <i>divinely instituted</i>. Besides, a distinction
of <i>clean</i> and <i>unclean</i> animals was observed before the deluge; which was
not from <i>nature</i>, but the mere divine pleasure; and may we not add, with a particular
respect to <i>sacrifices</i>? Now,</p>

<p class='c006'>If, according to Witsius and others, these <i>skins of beasts</i>, and <i>sacrifices</i>, were
appointed <i>seals of the righteousness of faith</i>; I would ask—Was the <i>covenant</i> directed
for the use of their <i>seed in common</i> with the parents, and not the <i>seal</i> in
like manner? For, if the seals be affixed to the covenant for <i>confirmation</i> of its
contents, as well as, in another view, for signification; I would fain know, by
what rule of construction we can infer, that the covenant <i>itself</i> belongs to the
parents and their seed <i>in common</i>, while the <i>confirmation</i> of it belongs <i>exclusively</i>
to the former? Is it not contrary to <i>custom</i> and <i>unreasonable</i> to conclude, that a
charter of privileges, or a testamentary instrument, (which by the way express
the nature of the covenant) belongs to a man and his heirs <i>alike</i>, but the confirming
seal respects the former <i>only</i>; while on the supposition, the sovereign,
or the testator, has given <i>no ground</i> for such partiality? Besides,</p>

<p class='c006'>If the covenant itself be a benefit to the persons to whom it is directed, as it
certainly is in <i>every</i> dispensation of it, it follows that the <i>confirmation</i> of it is so;
for parents, therefore, to <i>deny</i> their offspring all the share in such common benefits
they are capable of, without a divine warrant, is <i>unnatural</i>, and an act of <i>injustice</i>.
We may therefore conclude—that from Adam to Noah, the <i>covenant</i>
and its <i>seals</i> appertained to <i>infants</i> in common with their parents.</p>

<p class='c006'>We appeal next to that period of the church which extended from Noah to
Abraham: On which we observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>Whatever benefits and privileges belonged to the former dispensation, continue
to flow on to the present, if not <i>expressly</i> repealed; for the change of a dispensation
<i>of itself</i>, is no adequate cause of their abrogation. That would be as unreasonable
as to suppose that the bare change from night to day was, <i>of itself</i>,
an adequate cause of a man’s being disinherited. Or we may as well say, that
the abstract notion of an epoch in chronology has a real influence on the sequence
of events. Whatever covenant privileges, therefore, belonged to Noah and his family
<i>before</i> the deluge, if not expressly repealed, must belong to them <i>after</i> the
deluge. But,</p>

<p class='c006'>So far were these privileges from being abridged at this period, that they
were greatly enlarged and confirmed, by additional discoveries. For thus we
read, Gen. vi. 18. <i>But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shall come
into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.</i> Again,
chap. vii. 1. <i>And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou, and all thy house into the
ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.</i> And again, chap.
viii. 20. <i>And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast,
and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.</i> Once more, chap.
ix. 8, 9, 12, 13. <i>And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, And
I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you. And God
said, This is the token of the covenant I do set my bow in the cloud.</i> Hence we further
learn,</p>

<p class='c006'>That the covenant or divine charter, first given to Noah, <i>included</i> the preceding;
it was the <i>same covenant</i> with <i>additional grants</i>: for the Lord says, “I
will <i>establish</i> my covenant.” Lest Noah should infer that the drowning of the
world in wrath disannulled the well known covenant, God dissipates his fears,
by saying, “I will <i>establish</i> my covenant.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On Noah’s <i>account</i>, or <i>as belonging</i> to him, <i>all his house</i> or family was privileged.
The privilege is,—“Come thou, and <i>all thy house</i> into the ark.” The ground
and reason of that privilege—“<i>for thee have I seen righteous</i>.” It is true, the natural
dictates of reason and affection, whereby a <i>father pitieth his children</i>, and
whereby an infidel <i>careth for his own, especially those of his own house</i>, would have
prompted this righteous person to bring <i>all his family</i>, (except any adults <i>refused</i>
compliance) into the ark, (<i>the like figure whereunto is baptism</i>, as an inspired
teacher assures us, 1 Pet. iii. 21.) yet the Lord was pleased to brighten his evidence
and strengthen his obligations of duty by express revelation.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the flood the institution of <i>sacrifices</i> continued as the seal of the <i>first</i>
part of the covenant; and the <i>rainbow</i> was instituted as the seal of the <i>additional</i>
part, or, as Pareus calls it, “<i>appendix</i> of the covenant of grace.” And here
it is worthy of notice, that as the first exhibition of the covenant and its seals respected
the offspring of <i>fœderati</i>, and the <i>renewal</i> or <i>establishment</i> of it to Noah
retained that privilege in full force: so also the <i>appendix</i> of the covenant comprehended
his <i>seed</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Respecting this appendix of the covenant of which the rainbow was the seal,
though we suppose, with Witsius, it was not formally and precisely the covenant
of grace; yet we observe, with the same excellent author, “it does not
seem consistent with the divine perfections, to make such a covenant with every
living creature, but on <i>supposition</i> of a covenant of grace, and having a <i>respect</i>
to it.” And as this covenant, in its universality, implied the covenant of
grace, we are not to deny, but the promises of it were also <i>sealed</i> to Noah and
his seed by the rainbow. See Rev. iv. 3. x. 8.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is observable, finally, that Noah his <i>sons</i>, and <i>their seed</i> were <i>fœderati</i>, in
this ratification of the covenant; consequently whatever <i>seals</i> of the covenant
belonged to Noah, belonged to <i>his sons</i>, and <i>their seed</i>, while non-dissentients.</p>

<p class='c006'>Appeal we next to a very important period of sacred history, viz. From Abraham
to Moses. On this also we make the following remarks.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Abrahamic covenant <i>included</i> the preceding dispensations, on the general
principle—that grants and privileges continue in force until <i>repealed</i>. Which
repealing, if it be not either <i>express</i>, or arise from the nature of the case, in itself
<i>plain</i>, can have no binding influence, that is to say, no existence at all: except
we maintain, that we are <i>bound</i> to resign an important good without an assignable
cause; which is in fact to maintain that we ought to <i>deny</i> that to be,
which is.</p>

<p class='c006'>I suppose it will be granted, that the <i>principal blessing</i> exhibited in the foregoing
dispensations was <i>the righteousness of faith</i>; the great importance of which
to the human race, in every age of the world, no one will deny who considers
things <i>as they are</i>. This covenant, therefore, was in force to Abraham <i>prior</i> to
what is called the Abrahamic dispensation; and in this connexion we might
mention Lot and his family. But, behold,</p>

<p class='c006'>A most explicit ratification of it, with <i>superadded</i> favours, Gen. xii. 3.—<i>In
thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. And I will</i> establish my covenant
<i>between me and thee, and thy</i> seed <i>after thee in their generations, for an everlasting
covenant</i>; To be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee. <i>ver.</i> 10. <i>This is my
covenant which ye shall keep between me and you</i>, and thy seed <i>after thee</i>: every
man-<i>child among you shall be</i> circumcised, <i>ver.</i> 12. <i>He that is</i> eight days old <i>shall
be circumcised among you, every</i> man-<i>child in your generations; he that is born in
the house</i>, or bought with money of any stranger, <i>which is not of thy seed</i>. <i>ver.</i>
24-27. <i>And Abraham was</i> ninety years old and nine, <i>when he was circumcised in
the flesh of his foreskin. And Ishmael his son was</i> thirteen years old, <i>when he was
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. In the</i> self-same day <i>was Abraham circumcised,
and Ishmael his son. And</i> all the men of his house, <i>born in the house, and</i>
bought with money of the stranger, <i>were circumcised with him</i>. Hence we learn,</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>nature</i> and <i>extent</i> of the <i>Abrahamic covenant or promise</i>. Whatever <i>blessings</i>
are <i>promised</i> to ruined man, must be <i>in virtue</i> of the covenant of grace. All
promised blessings, therefore, must <i>imply</i> an <i>exhibition</i> of <i>gospel grace</i>. And the
glad tidings of salvation through Christ preached to the <i>gentile world</i>, is expressly
called—<i>The blessing of Abraham</i> (Gal. iii. 14.) Not that this <i>link</i> is the
<i>first</i> in the chain of exhibited mercy to the fallen race <i>in general</i>, or with an universal
and unlimited aspect, if the reasoning in the last sections be just: but
for its <i>explicitness</i>, and <i>precious</i> (because expressly diffusive) intendment, it
may be justly termed a <i>golden link</i>. In this respect Abraham may well be styled—<i>The
Father of us all</i>; not to the disavowal of Noah, with whom the covenant
was before ratified, or Eve, who received the <i>first</i> intimation of it, and who
in <i>this</i> respect eminently may be called—<i>The mother of all living</i>. The <i>covenant</i>
of grace, in its external manifestation, containing <i>an exhibition of exceeding
great and precious promises</i> to every human being on the face of the globe, to
whom providence directs the joyful news, may be compared to a flowing stream:
it proceeds ultimately from the immense ocean of sovereign grace in Christ;
its <i>first</i> visible source we trace to paradise, where it rises in a small spring, and
glides on to Noah. During this part of its progress, there were but few comparatively
who participated of its cleansing and healing virtues, though none were
debarred from it. This continuing to glide along, without interruption, (notwithstanding
God’s awful visitation of a corrupt world by the deluge) we discern
through the person of Noah <i>another</i> source, whence is poured forth a second
stream which empties itself into the former channel. The streams thus
<i>united</i> become a river, which flows on to Abraham—a river to which <i>all</i> are invited,
but <i>few</i> come, and these made willing by the omnipotent energy of <i>divine
influence</i> which observes the laws of another—a <i>hidden</i> dispensation, running parallel
as it were with the former; which was also the case in the preceding period.
Then, through the highly honoured person of Abraham we behold another
mighty spring copiously pouring forth the waters of salvation, and again uniting
itself to the former river; and from him to Christ, with a wide majestic flow,
it proceeds along the consecrated channel of the Jewish nation; gradually increasing
by the accession of other streams, till it arrives at the Saviour’s finished
work; where, impatient of confinement, it breaks over its banks on every
side, and the healing waters flow to the most distant regions—<i>That the blessing
of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles</i>. (Gal. iii. 14, 8. compared with Gen. xii.
3. xviii. 18. xxii. 18.) Paul expressly says, that “the <i>Gospel</i>” (even the very same
as the New Testament contains—<i>salvation by Grace</i>) “was preached to Abraham:”
And (Heb. iv. 2.) it was preached to his unbelieving descendants in
the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c006'>As it is <i>natural</i> to expect, that whatever exhibition of privileges the parents
enjoyed should be extended to their children, in common with themselves; so
we find that <i>in fact</i> they are <i>expressly included</i> in <i>this</i> dispensation as well as the
preceding. The covenant is established between God and Abraham’s <i>seed, in the
very same sense</i> as with Abraham <i>himself</i>; the essence of which is—<i>to be a God
to him and his seed</i>. And lest it should be objected that the term <i>seed</i> refers to his
<i>adult posterity</i> who should tread in his steps, to the exclusion of infants, all doubt
is dissipated by the appointment of applying the <i>seal</i> of the covenant in early infancy.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Sacrifices</i> continuing in full force to <i>seal</i> the covenant, till the divine oblation
should be made; and the <i>bow</i> of the covenant continuing as a token and <i>seal</i> of
it, until the Messiah’s <i>second</i> coming; at the commencement of this period is
given an <i>additional</i> seal—<i>circumcision</i>. The very <i>nature</i> of the rite shews that all
<i>females</i> are excluded from being the subjects of it; as well as the discriminating
specification—<i>every man-child</i>. Here observe in general, that children, in this rite,
have the same privileges as their parents. The males are treated as Abraham,
and the females as Sarah: <i>These</i> therefore, had the covenant sealed in the same
manner as their honoured mother. Again: though Sarah and her sex were not
the <i>subjects</i> of this rite, they were constant <i>witnesses</i> to the institution; and
therefore there was an important sense in which circumcision was a seal to Sarah
and her daughters; a sense analagous to that in which sacrifices were.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every domestic head being, in truth, a prophet, priest, and king, in his own
family; a question must arise, Whether the covenant and its seals are restricted
to the parent head of the family, and his children, or else extended to the <i>other
domestics</i>? Nor would the question be unimportant; for his <i>instructions</i>, his
<i>prayers</i>, and <i>commands</i>, answerable to his three-fold office, must be directed accordingly.
To this question right reason replies: If the covenant and its seals
are <i>beneficial</i> to all capable subjects, benevolence requires that they should be
extended to the other <i>non-dissenting</i> members—except forbidden by indisputable
authority. This is the voice of reason; and we find that this is the voice of God.
The privilege is common to the seed, and <i>to him that is born in the house, or
bought with money of any stranger</i>, which is not of the seed, Gen. xvii. 12.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been objected, “that the covenant with Abraham was a covenant of <i>peculiarity</i>
only, and that circumcision was no more than a token of <i>that</i> covenant;”
but if so, as Mr. Henry observes, “how came it that all <i>proselytes</i>, of what nation
soever, even <i>the strangers</i>, were to be circumcised; though not being of any
of the tribes, they had no part or lot in the land of Canaan? The extending the
seal of circumcision to <i>proselyted strangers</i>, and to <i>their seed</i>, was a plain indication,
that the New Testament administration of the covenant of grace would
reach, not to the covenanters only, but their <i>seed</i>.” But it has been proved
that circumcision <i>sealed</i> to Abraham and his seed <i>the righteousness of faith</i>; and
therefore it does not affect the point in debate to contend that temporal promises
were sealed <i>also</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>We next appeal to the long and interesting period from Moses to Christ, On
which let the following observations be considered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whatever appertained to the Abrahamic covenant was not disannulled by the
Mosaic dispensation. This St. Paul asserts in plain terms, Gal. iii. 17.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may not be amiss to take notice, before we proceed, of Job’s family; who,
being as is generally supposed, cotemporary with Moses, and unconnected with
his history, deserves a previous regard. Of him it is said, that “he <i>sanctified</i> his
children, and rose up early in the morning, and <i>offered burnt-offerings</i>, according
to the <i>number of them all</i>—Thus did Job <i>continually</i>,” or, all the days. (Job
i. 5.) On this I would only observe, let the <i>sanctifying</i> be what it may, the <i>sacrifices</i>
must have been of divine institution; and used by Job, being an eminently
righteous man, as the <i>seals</i> of the covenant of grace; with respect to his children
<i>separately</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Superadded to the foregoing seals of the covenant, is the <i>passover</i>; a divine
rite of the nature of a sacrifice, instituted in memory of Israel’s deliverance out
of Egypt, representing and sealing spiritual blessings. “As to the <i>guests</i>, says
Witsius, they were, first, all native <i>Israelites</i>, who were not excluded by legal
uncleanness. For <i>all the congregation of Israel</i> is commanded to solemnize the
passover. And, next, the <i>Proselytes</i> circumcised and become Jews; whether
bondmen born in the house or bought with money, &amp;c. Exod. xii. 48. <i>When a</i>
stranger <i>will sojourn with thee, and keep the passover to the Lord, let</i> all his
males <i>be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it, and he shall be as
one that is born in the land</i>.” On this passage in Exodus, Dr. Jennings observes
these two things; “<i>First</i>, That when a man thus became a Proselyte, <i>all his
males</i> were to be circumcised <i>as well as himself</i>, whereby his <i>children</i> were admitted
into the visible church of God, <i>in his right</i>, as their father. <i>Secondly</i>,
That upon this, he should be <i>entitled to all the privileges</i> and immunities of the
Jewish church and nation as well as be subject to the whole law: He should
be as one born in the land.” In short; not only men and women, but also young
children partook of this ordinance, <i>as soon as they were capable</i> of answering the
revealed design of it, for—no <i>positive</i> rule was given them on this head, like that
of circumcision. It is manifest that since the injunction respected not only individuals
of such a description, but also families <i>as such</i>, every member without
exception had a <i>legal right</i> to the ordinance; and nothing prevented <i>infants</i> from
a participation, but what lay in the <i>natural</i> incapacity to answer the design of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Besides the <i>ordinary</i> and <i>universal</i> sacraments of <i>circumcision</i> and the <i>passover</i>,
some <i>extraordinary</i> symbols of divine grace were granted to the Israelites
in the wilderness, which in the New Testament are applied to Christ and his
benefits, and said to have the same signification with our sacraments. And
they are in order these—The <i>passage</i> in the cloud <i>through the Red Sea</i>—the
<i>manna</i> which was rained from heaven—The <i>water</i> issuing out of the <i>rock</i>—and
the <i>brazen serpent</i> erected by Moses for the cure of the Israelites.” To
this we may add, among other things, with the author now referred to—the clear
and familiar display of the <i>divine majesty</i>—and the adumbration of divine mysteries
daily <i>sealed</i> by religious <i>ceremonies</i>. Our subject does not call for an investigation
of these particulars, but I would remark in general, that the principle for
which we contend, is so far from being weakened, that it is abundantly corroborated
by the inspired testimony of every dispensation, and the Mosaic in particular—That
it is a common dictate of right reason, children should from their
earliest infancy share in their parents’ privileges, as far as they are capable, when
no positive authority contravenes it.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the preceding induction of sacred evidence in favour of children being
sharers of the seals of grace in common with their parents, we conclude, that
for the space of four thousand years, that is to say, <i>from the creation to Christ</i>, it
was a rule <i>universally</i> incumbent on parents to treat their children as entitled to
religious privileges <i>equally</i> with themselves, according to their capacity.—And
as a counterpart of what was observed of privileges, we may remark that, in virtue
of the same uniform principle, often when the parents were punished with
excommunication or death, their infant children were included with them. As
might be instanced in—the deluge—the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah—the
case of Achan the Son of Zerah (Josh. vii. 24.)—the matter of Korah, Dathan,
and Abiram—the case of the conquered nations (Deut. xx. 16, 17.)—and many
more instances, down to the destruction of Jerusalem. Far be it from us to suppose,
that the parents’ crimes and impenitence made their suffering children incapable
of <i>mercy</i>—that mercy which proceeds on an invisible plan, and belongs
to a purely spiritual dispensation. Yet, that children, during their <i>dependence</i> on
their parents, should share equally with them in judgment and mercies externally,
is the effect of an all-wise constitution coeval with mankind.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Dr. Williams on Baptism.</span></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f74'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r74'>74</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Tertullian observes on this passage, that if either parent were christians,,
the children were enrolled in Jesus Christ by early baptism. And it fairly
implies infant baptism in the days of Paul. For, having declared that the unbelieving
partner was not to be divorced according to the law of Moses, which held
the heathen to be unclean; he pronounces the unbelievers set apart by such
marriage to God, as far as regarded that marriage; and in proof of this he refers
to a fact as known to the Corinthians, namely that the children of such marriages
were received into the church, and treated as holy, that is devoted to
God. Now if the children of such marriages were not treated as heathens, but
owned by the church, and this could be in no other way than by receiving them
by baptism, there can be no doubt, that this was the case when both parents
were believers.—Ακαθαρτος &amp; αλιος never mean <i>illegitimate</i> and <i>legitimate</i>; and
if they did, this would be no proof that the unbelieving party was consecrated
to God, so as that the children should be clean and devoted to him.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f75'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r75'>75</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All these scriptures which require faith, that is, the credible profession of
it, to precede baptism, are certainly directed only to those who are at years capable
of it, and not to infants. These scriptures do not exclude infants whose
claim is through the church-membership of their parents, by which they are not
“<i>unclean</i>,” 1 Cor. vii. 14. but <i>holy</i>, entitled to the promises made to the seed of
Abraham; and also by virtue of the commission to disciple <i>all nations</i>, of which
they are a part as much as their believing parents; and by the practical exposition
of that commission in the universal baptism of infants in the christian
churches for the first four hundred years.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f76'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r76'>76</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It may be objected, “If the preceding account be true, that baptism is
not an institution <i>merely positive</i>, as much so as any enacted under the Mosaic
dispensation; then the present economy hath no institutions at all of that kind.”
This objection supposes,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That precepts of a positive nature under the Mosaic dispensation, were absolutely
so in all their circumstances; so as not to leave any thing to be inferred
by the person or persons concerned, in the discharge of the duty enjoined.—But
if these things were so, if the Jewish ritual was so express as to leave nothing
to be determined by inference, one might well wonder whence could spring so
many <i>Targums</i> and <i>Talmuds</i>, so many voluminous works intended to explain and
illustrate the various circumstances attending the performance of these <i>positive
duties</i> among others. Are not these <i>unprescribed circumstances</i> of ritual worship,
and other positive injunctions, what in a great degree swell the interpretations
of the <i>Rabbins</i>?—The truth is, that there were many precepts under the Jewish
economy positive in a <i>considerable degree</i>, relative to the <i>subject</i> as well as the
mode of an institute, and respecting the former, it was sometimes particularly
scrupulous, for reasons already assigned; but it does not follow that <span class='fss'>ANY ONE</span>
of these were so strictly positive, as not to take some things for <i>granted</i> respecting
the circumstances of the duty, such as national custom, the common
dictates of sense and reason, traditionary knowledge, the general principles of
the law of nature, &amp;c. And it should not be forgotten, that the administrator
of the Jewish rites had the subjects distinguished and characterized in a <i>sensible
manner</i>, which qualification was to be determined by the same sort of evidence
as any <i>facts</i> in common life; but the administrator of the Christian rites
has no such grounds to proceed on; his commission is of a <i>discretionary</i> nature,
arising from the nature and design of the institutions themselves, as before
shewn.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The objection again supposes, that there is some <i>excellency</i> in an institution
being merely and absolutely positive, more than in one of a mixed nature. But
this supposition is vain and erroneous. For what conceivable superior excellency
can there be in any precept or duty on account of its <i>positiveness</i>? Were
there any force in the objection, it would imply that the Christian dispensation
is <i>less excellent</i> than the Mosaic; as having fewer positive rites, and their proportion
of positiveness being also smaller. And it would also imply, that the
reasonable duties of prayer and praise, as founded on the law of nature, as well
as more fully enjoined by revelation, were <i>less excellent</i> than baptism and the
Lord’s supper; and it would follow, that the services of the church triumphant
are in their own nature <i>less excellent</i> than those of the church militant; which
are consequences from the force of the objection equally genuine and absurd.
Our Lord’s answer respecting the first and great commandment, shews at once
that what is the most <i>important</i> duty, is also the most <i>natural</i>, and therefore the
most remote from what is merely positive; and that is the <i>love of God</i>. This
matter has been fully shewn before. In one word, the spirit of the objection is
truly pharisaic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some may perhaps object, “that this has been always admitted as true, that
baptism and the Lord’s supper are positive institutions of the New Testament;
and that many pædobaptists have availed themselves of this fort, in ascertaining
the nature and enforcing the obligation of the latter, and particularly bishop
Hoadly. And as his lordship’s principle, in his <i>Plain Account of the Sacrament
of the Lord’s Supper</i>, has been deemed unanswerable, Mr. Foot, Dr. Stennett,
and others, have taken but the same method in treating about baptism.” To
this I reply,</p>

<p class='c006'>That, as principles taken upon trust, dignified titles, and lawn sleeves, are
light as a feather in the scale of argument; so, on the other hand, I am satisfied
the bishop of Winchester’s positions, taken in a sound sense, nay, the <i>only</i> consistent
sense in which they can be taken, are evidently true and important. The
sum is this; that all positive duties, or duties made such by institution alone,
depend entirely upon the will and declaration of the person who institutes or
ordains them, with respect to the real design and end of them, and consequently,
to the due manner of performing them. This is strictly true, <i>in the degree that
any duties are positive</i>, but no further. And to denominate a precept or duty
<i>positive</i>, though but <i>partially</i> so, I have no objection, for the sake of distinguishing
them from such as are merely moral, and evidently founded on the reason
and nature of things. “Except we observe this caution,” as bishop Butler observes,
“we shall be in danger of running into endless confusion.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be said, “If we resign this maxim, that a positive precept or duty excludes
all moral reasoning, analogy and inference, we open a door to numberless
innovations, and deprive ourselves of a necessary barrier against the encroachments
of popery, &amp;c.” In reply to this specious objection let it be observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. That this maxim, whatever confidence our opponents place in it, is a very
<i>insufficient</i> barrier for the defence of truth, if the objection implies, that it is calculated
to defend truth against error, and not error against truth as well. For
it is notorious, that there is hardly any extravagance, in the whole compass of
the distinguishing peculiarities of religious practice, that is not barricadoed by
this very maxim. If <i>Protestants</i> use it against Papists, <i>Papists</i> in their turn use
it against Protestants. If the Quakers are pursued and foiled when they
occasionally quit this fort, they soon rally their controversial forces, and,
entrenching themselves behind the strength of this maxim, become again
victorious. Whence passive obedience and non-resistance? Whence an opposition
to all <i>forensic</i> swearing, in common with profane? Whence the
Quakers’ nonconformity to what other serious Christians consider as lawful?
Their peculiar mode of salutation and address? Their method of conducting
religious worship? The little stress they lay on the observance of the christian
Sabbath? &amp;c. Whence the popish absurd figment of transubstantiation, apostolical
succession, extreme unction? &amp;c.—On the contrary,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Not to distinguish between the <i>positiveness</i> and <i>morality</i> of a precept, ordinance
or duty, and not to ascertain their respective <i>degrees</i>; and to deny that
the <i>latter</i> distinction admits of moral reasoning, inference and analogy, open a
wide door to <i>bigotry</i>, and numberless glaring abuses of the sacred oracles. By
rejecting the analogy of faith and the <i>design</i> of scripture herein, we give the
most effectual encouragement to every senseless intrusion. And what is still
more remarkable is, that the <i>more firmly</i> any one adheres to the undistinguishing
positive scheme, in reference to any christian ordinance whatever, the more
closely will he be allied to the interest of genuine bigotry. For it has a direct
tendency to make the unprescribed circumstances of a positive rite, <i>essential</i> to
the rite itself, and consequently to make that necessary and essential which the
institutor has not made so. How far this is applicable to the antipædobaptist’s
cause, will be further considered.—The doctrine that teaches the propriety of
yielding our reason to positive institutions <i>as such</i>, or in the <i>degree</i> they are so,
is just and proper, as founded on the sovereign, absolute and manifest authority
of the Supreme Legislator; and in this view it has been of singular service in
refuting the cavils of deistical impiety. But to carry the principle any further,
tends to betray the cause of christianity into the hands of infidels, and to breed
unhallowed party zeal and uncharitable animosities among its sincerest professors.
“For who are most likely to put weapons into the hands of <i>infidels</i>;
they, who seem to discard <i>reason</i> in the investigation of truth, or they, whose
researches are founded on her most vigorous exertions, and most rational decisions?—They,
who make scripture bow to their preconceived notions, in direct
opposition to the dictates of reason and common sense, or they, whose arguments
are founded on a <i>coalition</i> of scripture and right reason?” Once more,</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The objection, as it includes Mr. B.’s favourite maxim, and tends to oppose
the distinction above stated, involves a great inconsistence with itself. For on
what principle, except what they affect to discard, do our opponents retain
<i>some</i> of the positive rites of the New Testament and reject <i>others</i>? Why regard
<i>baptism</i> and the <i>eucharist</i> as of standing obligation; while the <i>pedilavium</i> and
<i>feasts of charity</i> (the <i>former</i> enjoined expressly by our Lord, and <i>both</i> practised
by the disciples of the apostolic age, see John xiii. 14, 15. 1 Tim. v. 10. Jude
12.) are judged unworthy of continuance? Why receive <i>females</i> to communion,
or adopt the <i>first</i> day of the week for the christian sabbath? How can they
justify their conduct in these matters, these circumstances of <i>positive</i> institutions,
without undermining their own avowed hypothesis? With regard to the
sabbath, indeed, the antipædobaptists are divided among themselves; while
some are content with the <i>first</i> day of the week, others observe the <i>seventh</i>. On
this point Dr. S. is very open and ingenious; Mr. Addington appeals to an objecting
antipædobaptist, “whether he does not think himself sufficiently authorized
to keep the christian sabbath, though Christ has no where said in so many
words, <i>Remember the first day of the week to keep it holy</i>?” To this the Dr. replies,
“There is, I acknowledge, some weight in this objection: and all I can
say to it is, that not having yet met with any passage in the New Testament
that appears to me to have repealed the fourth commandment, and to have required
the observation of the first day, I cannot think myself sufficiently authorized
to renounce that, and to keep this.” If the doctor is professedly an
observer of the Jewish sabbath, he is consistent with himself, however different
from so great a part of the christian world; if <i>not</i>, he and his tenet are at variance:
analogy and inferential reasoning have got the better of the positive system,
which nevertheless must not be resigned, for fear of worse consequences.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another objection much insisted on is, “If our Lord has left any thing to be
<i>inferred</i> relative to the <i>subject</i> and <i>mode</i> of baptism, being a positive institute;
or if he has not delivered himself <i>expressly</i> and <i>clearly</i> in every thing, respecting
the question <i>who</i> are to be baptized, and the manner <i>how</i>; it implies a reflexion
on his wisdom and goodness.” But this objection is impertinent on different
accounts. For,</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Its force is derived from the supposition that the Institutor was somehow
<i>obliged</i> to make his will known to men by <i>one</i> method only. But is the Great
Supreme under any such obligations to his absolutely dependent creatures?
What should we say of a philosopher, who, having to judge of any important
phenomenon in physics, should quarrel with the author of nature, because he
had not confined his method of information to <i>one</i> source only, to the exclusion
of all others? That his evidence, for instance, was not confined to the information
of <i>sense</i>, to the exclusion of <i>reason</i> and <i>analogy</i>? Or what should we say of
a person, who having to decide on the truth and reality of a miracle, should impeach
the wisdom and goodness of his Maker, because he did not appeal to <i>one</i>
sense only of his dependent and unworthy creatures, that of <i>seeing</i>, for instance,
to the exclusion of that of <i>hearing</i>? The answer is plain, and the application
easy.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The objection is guilty of another impertinence, nearly allied to the former:
it unreasonably requires <i>positive</i> evidence for what is discoverable by <i>other</i>
means. It is demonstrable, and I think has been demonstrated, that the qualifications
of the subjects of baptism (the <i>mode</i> also will be examined in its place)
is what cannot possibly be determined by any positive rule whatever as such,
but must be resolved to the <i>discretionary</i> nature of the commission, or the supposed
<i>wisdom</i> and <i>prudence</i> of the administrators, in common with other parts
of the same commission, such as the choice of an <i>audience</i>, the choice of a concionatory
<i>subject</i>, &amp;c. Preach the <i>gospel</i> to <i>every creature</i>, is a part of the commission,
but the execution has no <i>positive</i> rule. Nor does this commission of
preaching the <i>gospel</i> prohibit preaching the <i>law</i>, for a lawful use, or any branch
of natural religion, notwithstanding Mr. B.’s excluding standard, that “positive
laws imply their negatives.” In like manner, the commission to baptize <i>believers</i>,
and the <i>taught</i>, we contend and prove, does not mean to include <i>all sorts</i>
of believers and taught persons, but such of them as the administrators judge
fit, according to the rules of christian prudence and discretion. And we further
insist, as shall be more fully shewn hereafter, that the terms of the commission,
<i>believers</i> and <i>taught</i>, stand <i>opposed</i>, not to <i>non-believers</i> and <i>untaught</i>,
but to <i>unbelievers</i> and persons <i>perversely ignorant</i>. What, therefore, falls <i>necessarily</i>
to the province of inferential reasoning, is impertinently referred to a positive
standard.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The objection implies an <i>ungrateful</i> reflexion on the Institutor’s wisdom
and goodness, contrary to what it pretends to avoid. And this it does, by counteracting
and vilifying those natural dictates of reason, prudence and common
sense, that our all-wise and beneficent Creator has given us—his <i>goodness</i>, in not
suspending their operations, but leaving them in full force, as to these circumstances
of positive duties—his <i>wisdom</i>, in grafting what is positive of his laws on
these common principles—and finally, the favourable circumstance of his diminishing
the degree of positiveness in New Testament institutions, as well as
their number.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us now recapitulate what has been said in this chapter—From an investigation
of the <i>nature</i> of positive precepts and duties, as distinguished from
<i>moral</i> ones, together with their <i>comparative</i> obligations and importance, we have
seen, that, in any case of supposed competition, the <i>latter</i> claims an undoubted
<i>preference</i>. We have also seen, that nothing but absolute, decisive, <i>discernible
authority</i> can turn the scale in favor of the <i>former</i>, or, indeed, place any law or
duty in the rank of <span class='fss'>POSITIVE</span>. Moreover, it has been shewn, that every duty resulting
from any discernible <i>moral relation</i>, must needs be classed among <i>moral
duties</i>; that some things appertaining to the very <i>essence</i> of baptism, on our opponents’
own principles, are of moral consideration; particularly the qualifications
of proper subjects; consequently, that baptism is an ordinance of a <i>mixed
nature</i>, partly positive and partly moral. Of all which an unavoidable consequence
is, that our opponents’ outcry against all <i>moral</i> and <i>analogical reasons</i> in
our enquiries respecting the subjects and mode of baptism, is impertinent and
absurd, and to a demonstration contradictory to their own avowed principles.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r85'>85</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is very remarkable, that in those ages and countries, <i>where</i> the <i>mode</i>
of dipping has been, or still is, the most prevalent, <i>there infant-baptism</i> has been
the most generally practised, and <i>there</i> the <i>mode</i> of baptizing has not been
deemed essential. Instead, therefore, of finding <i>all</i> these people Baptists, but
<i>very few, if any</i>, of that denomination, are to be found among them. Dr. Wall,
who was himself an advocate for dipping, tells us, “that all christians in the
world, <i>who never owned the pope’s authority</i>, do now, and ever did, dip their
infants, in the ordinary use.” They always baptized their infants; and, ordinarily,
by dipping, but not universally, for they, occasionally, sprinkled them.
The mode of dipping was of ordinary use; but the practice of infant-baptism,
in those churches who <i>were never under the influence of popery</i>, appears to have
been <i>universal</i>, both in ancient and modern times.</p>

<p class='c006'>We do not pretend to rest the proof of infants’ right to baptism upon historical
evidence, relative to the ancient practice of the church in this respect. However,
if it should appear, that the churches, soon after the apostles, did admit
the infant children of believing parents to baptism—if no account can be produced,
of any church that rejected them—if no individual can be named, who
pretended that the practice was unlawful, or an innovation—these facts will certainly
furnish a very weighty argument in favour of the aforesaid doctrine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Baptism is an important transaction of a public nature. Those christians,
who lived and wrote in the earliest times after the apostles, must have known
what <i>their</i> practice was, with reference to the infant children of believers. The
testimony of these ancient writers, as historians or witnesses, respecting this
plain matter of fact, justly claims our most impartial and attentive consideration.
It is not, however, my intention to write a complete history of infant-baptism.
A history of this kind has been written a century ago, by Dr. Wall, a very
correct and judicious historian. This history is highly approved and recommended
by the best judges, being a work of great merit, candour and impartiality.</p>

<p class='c006'>On February 9th, 1705, the clergy of England, assembled in general convention,
“<i>ordered</i>, that the thanks of this house be given to Mr. Wall, vicar of
Shoreham in Kent, for the learned and excellent book he hath lately written
concerning infant-baptism; and that a committee be appointed to acquaint
him with the same.” Dr. Atterbury, a leading member in said convention,
says, “that the history of infant-baptism was a book, for which the author deserved
the thanks, not of the English clergy alone, but of all the Christian
churches.” Mr. Whiston also, a very learned man, well acquainted with the
writings of the Fathers of the four first centuries, and a professed Baptist, in his
address to the people of that denomination, declares to them, “that Dr. Wall’s
history of <i>infant-baptism</i>, as to facts, appeared to him most accurately done,
and might be depended on by the Baptists themselves.” <i>Mem. of his life</i>, part
2, page 461.</p>

<p class='c006'>The aforesaid history is still extant in two volumes. The same author has
since published another volume, which is a defence of the two former volumes,
against the reflections of Dr. Gale and others. In these publications, he has
favoured us with the testimony and sayings of the ancient Fathers, with respect
to infant-baptism, a few of which I shall produce, as authorities on the present
occasion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Justin Martyr, who wrote about forty years after the apostolic age, says, “We
have not received the carnal but spiritual circumcision, by baptism. And it
is enjoined on all persons to receive it in the same way.” He here evidently
considers baptism as being in the place of circumcision, and, consequently, like
that ancient rite, designed for infants as well as for adults. In one of his apologies
for the christians, he observes, “Several persons among us, of sixty or
seventy years old, who were made disciples to Christ from their childhood,
do continue uncorrupt.”—<i>Who were made disciples.</i>—Take notice; for he
makes use of the very same word that was used in the commission given to the
apostles. <i>Disciple all nations, baptizing them</i>, &amp;c. Now, if infant children were
made disciples, they were undoubtedly baptized. Justin wrote about 105 years
after the ascension of Christ. Those persons whom he mentions were then 70
years old; and consequently born and made disciples, in the times of the
apostles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Irenæus, who wrote about sixty-seven years after the apostles, and was then
an aged man, says, concerning Christ, “he came to save all persons who by
him are regenerated (or baptized) unto God, <i>infants</i>, little ones, youths and
elderly persons.” He speaks of <i>infants</i> and <i>little ones</i> as being regenerated.
It is evident from his own words that he had reference to their baptism; for he
tells us, “When Christ gave his apostles the command of <i>regenerating</i> unto
God, he said, go and teach all nations <i>baptizing</i> them.” The ancient Fathers
as customarily used the word regeneration for baptism, as the church of England
now use the word christening. Justin Martyr, whose name and testimony
we have already mentioned, speaking of some particular persons who had been
baptized, says, “they are regenerated in the same way of regeneration, in which
we have been regenerated, for they are <i>washed with water in the</i> name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of <i>the Holy Ghost</i>.” In this short sentence, the
word regeneration, or regenerated, is put for baptism no less than three times.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a matter of <i>no</i> importance in the present dispute, whether the primitive
Fathers used the aforesaid word properly or improperly. We certainly know
in what sense they did use it, and this is all the information needed. I would
however repeat a former observation, viz. that by a common figure, the thing
signified is often substituted for the sign, and the sign for the thing signified.
Thus, the Abrahamic covenant is sometimes put, by God himself, for circumcision;
and circumcision, the sign and token thereof, is sometimes put for the
covenant. Accordingly, baptism has been put for regeneration; and regeneration,
for baptism.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have already shown, that the Jews were in the habit of baptizing the Gentile
proselytes, even before the time of John and of Christ. They considered
these proselytes as being, by baptism, born the children of Abraham; and
therefore expressed their baptism, by regeneration. Accordingly, Christ and
his apostles, on some particular occasions, adopted a similar language. Our Saviour
said to Nicodemus, <i>except one be born again—except he be born of water
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God</i>. By this new birth, Christ
evidently had reference to water baptism, as truly as to the renewing of the Holy
Ghost. The apostle Paul styles baptism, <i>the washing of regeneration</i>. The ancients
commonly expressed baptism with water, by regeneration; for they considered
this external sacrament as a sign of internal, spiritual renovation and purification,
Irenæus expressly calls baptism regeneration, and says that <i>infants</i> were <i>regenerated</i>,
that, is baptized. His testimony is plain and full; and cannot be doubted
by any person acquainted with the phraseology and writings of the Fathers. He
mentions not only old persons and youths, but also little ones, and even infants.
This Irenæus was bishop of Lyons in France. According to Mr. Dodwell, he
was born before the death of St. John—was brought up in Asia, where that
apostle had lived and died. He was acquainted with Polycarp; and in his
younger years, had often heard him preach. Polycarp was John’s disciple, had
been chosen by him to be bishop of Smyrna—and probably that angel of the
church, so highly commended in the 2d chapter of Rev. Irenæus, and those
Christians who lived in an age so near the apostles, and in a place where one of
them had so lately resided, could not be ignorant—they must have known what
the apostolic practice was, with respect to infant-baptism—a matter of the most
notorious and public nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Lathrop observes, “that Tertullian, who flourished about one hundred
years after the apostles, gives a plain testimony, that the church admitted infants
to baptism in his time. It is true, he advises to <i>delay</i> their baptism; not
because it was <i>unlawful</i>, for he allows of it in cases of necessity; but because
the <i>sponsors</i> were often brought into a snare; and because he imagined that
sins, committed <i>after baptism</i>, were next to unpardonable. He accordingly advises
that unmarried persons be kept from this ordinance, until they either
marry or are confirmed in continence. His advising to a delay, supposes that
infant-baptism was practised, for otherwise there would have been no room for
the advice. He does not speak of it as an <i>innovation</i>, which he would certainly
have done, had it <i>begun</i> to have been practised in his time. His words rather
imply the contrary. His speaking of <i>sponsors</i>, who engaged for the education of
the infants that were baptized, shows that there had been such a custom. And
his asking, ‘why that innocent age <i>made such haste</i> to baptism,’ supposes that
infants had usually been baptized, soon after their birth. So that he fully
enough witnesses to the <i>fact</i>, that it had been the practice of the church to baptize
infants. And his advice to delay their baptism, till they were grown up and
married, was one of those odd and singular notions for which this father was
very remarkable.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This quotation agrees well with the account given of Tertullian, by Dr. Wall
and other approved writers. Tertullian was evidently a man of abilities and
learning, and in some respects an useful writer. His integrity and veracity were
never questioned. But as has been hinted, he held to some strange and peculiar
notions. He was not deemed perfectly orthodox by the ancient Christians. Being
a person of warm imagination, he expressed himself, very strongly, on different
subjects, at different times; and some have thought, in a manner that
was not consistent. Some of the later Baptists have even pretended that he denied
infant-baptism. But these considerations do not disqualify him as a witness
in the present case. Instead of invalidating, they serve to confirm his testimony.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Gill says, that Tertullian is the first man who <i>mentions</i> infant-baptism, and
speaks against it; and infers that it had not come into use before his time. To
this, Mr. Clark, in his answer, replies, “So he is the first man, I suppose, that
mentions the baptism of unmarried people, virgins, and widows, and speaks
against it, and as earnestly pleads for its delay till the danger of temptation is
past; till marriage, or the abatement of lust. But will it thence follow, that
the baptism of such unmarried persons did not obtain in the church till Tertullian’s
time? Or that it then first began to be in use? Our author might as
reasonably have inferred the latter opinion, as the former. But the very
words, in which he expresses his advice against baptizing infants, plainly imply
that it was a common practice. After all, what is it that Tertullian has
said against infant-baptism? He has given it as his judgment, that it would
be more profitable to defer their baptism, until they come to riper years, and
were able to understand something of its nature and design; but he does not
like the anti-pædobaptists, condemn it as unlawful; which he would have
done, if it had been a novel practice—an innovation, contrary to the rule of
scripture, or without the approbation or direction of the apostles. On the
contrary, he allows it in case of necessity, of sickness, and danger of death.
Dr. Gill, instead of saying, that Tertullian was the first man who mentioned
infant-baptism, and spoke against it, ought to have said, that he was the <i>only
man</i>, in all antiquity, whose writings have come down to us, who has said any
thing at all against the practice of baptizing infants.” The very advice, however,
which he gave, plainly shows, that infant-baptism was then commonly
practised. He does not intimate, that the practice was of human invention, or
not authorized by the apostles. His private opinion, with respect to the expediency
of delaying baptism in several cases, and the reasons which he offered,
are nothing to us. We have only cited him as a voucher to an ancient fact; and
the testimony which he has given affords clear and incontestable proof of said
fact, viz. that infants were baptized in his times.</p>

<p class='c006'>Origen, who flourished in the beginning of the third century, and was for
some time contemporary with Tertullian, in his 8th homily on Levit. 12, observes,
“David, speaking concerning the pollution of infants, says, <i>I was conceived
in iniquity, and in sin did my mother bring me forth</i>. Let it be considered
what is the reason, that whereas the baptism of the church is given for forgiveness,
infants also, by the usage of the church, are baptized; when if there
were nothing in infants, which wanted forgiveness and mercy, the grace of
baptism would be needless to them. And again, infants are baptized for the
remission of sin. Of what sin? Or when have they sinned? Or how can any
reason of the laver hold good in their case? But according to that sense before
mentioned, none is free from pollution, though his life be only the length
of one day upon the earth. It is for this reason that infants are baptized, because
by the sacrament of baptism, our pollution is taken away.” In another
treatise, he says, “the church had a tradition, or command from the apostles, to
give baptism to infants! for they, to whom the divine mysteries were committed,
knew that there is, in all persons, the natural pollution of sin, which
ought to be washed away by water and the spirit; by reason of which pollution,
the body itself is also called <i>the body of sin</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c006'>These testimonies of Origen are full and unequivocal. They put the matter
in debate beyond all reasonable doubt, if any credit can be given to them; and
no reason appears, why they should not be credited. It is true, they are taken
from Latin translations. Origen wrote in the Greek language. But the fidelity
of the translators and authenticity of these passages, have been sufficiently vindicated
by Dr. Wall, even to the entire satisfaction of all impartial enquirers.
None will object, but those persons who are disposed to cavil.</p>

<p class='c006'>I perceive that you have admitted the aforesaid facts; but have made an unusual
outcry against the tradition and order from the apostles, mentioned by
Origen. There is, I suspect, more policy and popularity in your remarks, than
real weight. It will not do for us to turn those weapons against the ancient
Fathers and holy apostles, which the protestants have used with so much success,
in their disputes with the Papists.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us hear what St. Paul says, with respect to traditions. 2 Thess. ii. 15.
“Therefore, brethren, <i>stand fast, and hold the traditions</i> which ye have been
taught, whether <i>by word</i>, or our epistle.” And in the 3d chap. 6th verse, he
says, “Now we <i>command</i> you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and
not after the <i>tradition</i> which he received of us.” So also in 1 Corin. 11th
chap. 2d verse. “Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all
things, and keep the <i>ordinances</i> (the <i>traditions</i>, paradoseis) as I delivered
them to you.” The apostle was here speaking of christian ordinances, which
he calls <i>traditions</i>. The original word signifies <i>traditions</i>, and is so rendered by
our translators in the other aforecited passages.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, sir, you see in what a solemn manner—<i>in the name of Christ</i>, the holy
apostle charged the primitive christians, <i>to hold and keep the</i> traditions—not
merely such as had been written by the pen of inspiration, but also those which
were delivered to them <i>by word</i>, or in an oral and verbal manner, and with particular
reference to the rules and ordinances of the gospel. The traditions and
commandments of mere men, which pretend to divine authority, are to be rejected.
But those traditions are not to be treated with sneer and ridicule,
which were delivered by the apostles to the primitive christians—recorded and
authenticated by the ancient Fathers—and transmitted down to us, by the
faithful historian.</p>

<p class='c006'>Origen has expressly informed us, that infant-baptism was practised in his
time. With respect to this matter of fact, Origen was certainly a competent
witness; and he had every opportunity, and advantage for knowing what had
been the practice of his predecessors and even of the apostles. Many of the
ancient Fathers were illiterate, and descended from heathen parents; and being
the first of their family who embraced christianity, must have been baptized
when adults. But Origen was one of the most learned men of the age. He was
born and educated at Alexandria in Egypt, but travelled into Rome, and
Greece, and Capadocia, and Arabia. He resided for some time in several of the
most eminent churches, and spent the greatest part of his life in Syria and Palestine.
His ancestors were christians. Eusebius tells us, that his forefathers
had been christians, for several generations. His father was martyred, in the
persecution under Severus.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is very remarkable, that his pedigree should have been so accurately ascertained.
The occasion was this: Porphyry, a great enemy to christianity, had
represented the christians as being an ignorant people, destitute of science; but
not being able to conceal the repute of Origen, for his uncommon skill in human
literature, pretended that he had been at first a heathen, and had learned
their philosophy. In order to confute this falsehood, Eusebius enquired into
his ancestry, and set forth his christian descent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Origen was born in the year of our Lord 185, that is, eighty-five years after
the apostles. He was seventeen years old when his father suffered martyrdom.
He had himself, undoubtedly, been baptized in his infancy; and must have been
informed concerning the practice of the apostles, respecting the baptizing of
infants; for his grandfather, or at least his great-grandfather, lived in the apostolic
times, and they both were christians. This is the man, who has expressly
declared, that infants were baptized in his day, and that the church was directed
by an order or tradition from the apostles, to baptize them. His circumstances
were such as afforded him all the necessary and suitable means for obtaining
information. We have no reason to suspect his credibility as a witness;
and nothing can be more unreasonable, than to reject or treat his testimony
with contempt. It is a circumstance worthy of our <i>very particular notice</i>, that
Origen and the other ancient Fathers do not speak of infant-baptism as being a
practice that was denied or opposed by any one. They mention it as a practice
generally known and approved, and for the purpose of illustrating and confirming
other points that were then disputed.</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall now produce the testimony of the blessed martyr Cyprian, who was
for some time contemporary with Origen; and next to him, the most noted
Christian writer of that age. Cyprian was constituted bishop or minister of
Carthage, in the year 248, and Origen died in the year 252. The testimony of
this ancient saint, to which I now have an immediate reference, was occasioned
by a question proposed to him, by one Fidus, a <i>presbyter</i>, or minister in the
country, viz. Whether <i>an infant might be baptized before he was eight days old</i>?
The reason of his doubt, it seems, was an article in the law respecting circumcision,
which, under the Old Testament dispensation, required that infants
should be circumcised on the eighth day from their birth. Pursuant to the
aforesaid question, an ecclesiastical council of sixty-six bishops, having convened
at Carthage, A. D. 253, Cyprian proposed a resolution of the following import,
viz. “that an infant might be baptized on the second or third day, or at
any time after its birth; and that circumcision, besides being a sacramental
rite, had something in it of a typical nature; and particularly, in the circumstance
of being administered on the eighth day, which ceased at the coming of
Christ, who has given us baptism, the spiritual circumcision; in which ordinance,
we are not thus restricted, with respect to the age or time of administration.”
To this resolution the council agreed unanimously; as it appears
from the testimony of Cyprian in his epistle to Fidus, from which I shall extract
a few paragraphs, in order to show the sentiments of those venerable and ancient
saints relative to infant-baptism.—The inscription is as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cyprian and the rest of the colleagues, who are present in council, in number
sixty-six, to Fidus our brother,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Greeting.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As to the case of infants, whereas <i>you judge that they must not be baptized
within two or three days after they are born; and that the law of the ancient circumcision
is to be observed; so that you think none should be baptized and sanctified,
until the eighth day after their birth</i>; we were all in our assembly of a quite
different opinion. For in this matter, with respect to that which you thought
fitting to be done, there was not one of your mind. But all of us rather judged,
that the grace and mercy of God is not to be denied to any person born. For
whereas our Lord in his gospel, <i>the Son of Man came not to destroy men’s souls</i>
(or lives) <i>but to save them</i>.—That the eighth day, appointed to be observed in
the Jewish circumcision, was a type going before in a shadow, or resemblance,
but on Christ’s coming was fulfilled in the substance; for because the eighth
day, that is the next after the Sabbath, was to be the day on which the Lord
was to rise from the dead, and quicken us, and give us the spiritual circumcision.
This eighth day, that is, the next to the Sabbath, or the Lord’s day,
went before in the type, which type ceased when the substance came, and the
spiritual circumcision was given to us. So that we judge, no person is to be
hindered from obtaining the grace, (that is <i>of baptism</i>) by the law which is
now established; and that the spiritual circumcision ought not to be restrained
by the circumcision which was according to the flesh; but that all
are to be admitted to the grace of Christ; since Peter, speaking in the Acts
of the apostles, says, <i>the Lord hath shown me that no person is to be called common
or unclean</i>. This, therefore, dear brother, was our opinion in the assembly,
that it is not for us to hinder any person from baptism, and from the grace of
God, who is merciful, and kind, and affectionate to all. Which rule, as it
holds for all, so we think it is more especially to be observed in reference to
infants, and those that are newly born, to whom our help and the divine mercy
is rather to be granted, because by their weeping and wailing at their first entrance
into the world, they do intimate nothing so much as that they implore
compassion,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>Saint Ambrose, who wrote about 274 years after the apostles, declares expressly,
“that infant-baptism was practised in his time, and in the time of the
apostles.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Saint Chrysostom observes, “that persons may be baptized either in their infancy,
in middle age, or in old age.”—He tells us, infants were baptized, although
they had no sin; and that the sign of the cross was made upon their
foreheads at baptism.—Saint Hierome says, “if infants be not baptized, the
sin of omitting their baptism is laid to the parent’s charge.”—Saint Austin,
who wrote at the same time, about 280 years after the apostles, speaks “of infant-baptism
as one of those practices which was not <i>instituted by any council</i>, but
had <i>always</i> been in use.” The <i>whole church of Christ</i>, he informs us, <i>had constantly
held</i> that infants were baptized for the forgiveness of sin.—That he
“had <i>never read or heard</i> of <i>any Christian, Catholic</i> or <i>sectary</i>, who held otherwise.”—“That
no christian, of any sort, ever denied it to be useful or necessary.”
“If any one,” saith he, “should ask for divine authority in this matter,
though that, which the whole church practises, and which has not been instituted
by councils, but was ever in use, may be believed, very reasonably, to be
a thing delivered or ordered by the apostles, yet we may, besides, take a true
estimate, how much the sacrament of baptism does avail infants, by the circumcision
which God’s former people received.”</p>

<p class='c006'>No one of these ancient Fathers ever wrote directly in favour of, or against,
infant-baptism. In their various discourses and writings, they often mention it,
occasionally and transiently, when discoursing on some other subject.—They
mention it as a general practice of universal notoriety, about which there was
no controversy, in order to confute some prevailing heresy, or establish certain
doctrines, that were then disputed. Similar testimonies might easily be produced
from the writings of many other ancient witnesses, but this would unnecessarily
add to the prolixity of the present work. I will therefore conclude, by
stating very briefly, the incontestible and conclusive evidence in proof of infant-baptism,
arising out of the well-known Pelagian controversy respecting original
sin, which happened about three hundred years after the apostles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pelagius held, that infants were born free from any natural and sinful defilements.
The chief opposers of him and his adherents were Saint Hierome, and
Saint Austin, who constantly urged, very closely, in all their writings upon the
subject, the following argument, viz. “<i>That infants are, by all christians, acknowledged
to stand in need of baptism, which must be in them for original sin,
since they have no other</i>.” “If they have no sin, why are they then baptized,
according to the rule of the church, <i>for the forgiveness of sins? Why are they
washed in the laver of regeneration, if they have no pollution?</i>” Pelagius, and
also Celestius, one of his principal abettors, were extremely puzzled and embarrassed
with this argument. They knew not how to evade or surmount its force,
but by involving themselves in greater absurdities and difficulties. Some persons
aggravated the supposed error, by charging upon them the denial of infant-baptism,
as a consequence that followed from their tenet. Pelagius disclaimed
the slanderous imputation with abhorrence, declaring that he was accused
falsely. In the confession of faith, Pelagius then exhibited, which Dr.
Wall has recited, he owns, “<i>that baptism ought to be administered to infants,
with the same sacramental words which are used in the case of adult persons</i>.”—He
vindicates himself in the strongest terms, saying, “<i>that men slander him as
if he denied the sacrament of baptism to infants, and did promise the kingdom of
heaven to any person without the redemption of Christ; and affirms that he never
heard of any, not even the most impious heretic, that would say such a thing of infants</i>.”
Now these difficulties would have been instantly removed, and the battery,
which so greatly annoyed them, been demolished at once, by only denying that
infants were to be baptized. But they did not suggest or entertain any doubt at
all respecting this doctrine. Pelagius readily avowed, in the most explicit manner,
the incontested right, and the established immemorial practice of infant-baptism.
Celestius also confessed, “that infants were to be baptized according
to the <i>rule of the universal church</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>One of these men was born and educated in Britain, and the other in Ireland.
They both lived a long time at Rome, the centre of the world and place to which
all people resorted. Celestius settled at Jerusalem, and Pelagius travelled over
all the principal churches of Europe, Asia and Africa. If there had been any
number of churches, or a single church, in any part of the world, not only in
that but in the two preceding ages, who denied the baptism of infants, these
learned, sagacious persons must have known or heard of it; and certainly they
would have mentioned it, in order to check the triumph of their opponents, and
to wrest from them that argument, by which, above all others, they were most
grievously pressed. It is evident there was no society of Baptists then in the
world, nor had there been any of that denomination, within the memory of man.
The confession of Pelagius and Celestius amounts almost to demonstration. It
proves, beyond all reasonable doubt, that infant-baptism had universally obtained,
and had always been practised among christians, even from the apostolic
times.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Wall, who enjoyed the best advantages for being acquainted with the
history of infant-baptism, and who made this the principal subject of his studies
and enquiries, briefly sums up the evidence on both sides, in the following
words: “Lastly, for the first four hundred years, there appears only one man,
Tertullian, who advised the <i>delay</i> of infant-baptism in some cases, and one
Gregory, who did <i>perhaps</i> practise such <i>delay</i> in the case of his own children;
but no society of men so thinking or so practising; or any one man saying it
was unlawful to baptize infants. So in the next seven hundred years, there is
not so much as <i>one</i> man to be found, who either spoke for or practised any
such delay, but all the contrary. And when about the year 1130, one sect
among the Waldenses or Albigenses declared against the baptizing of infants,
<i>as being incapable of salvation</i>, the main body of that people rejected their opinion;
and they of them who held that opinion, quickly dwindled away and
disappeared, there being no more persons heard of, holding that tenet, until
the rising of the German anti-pædobaptists in the year 1522.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r88'>88</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See Dr. Owen’s complete Collection of Sermons, page 580, 581. of dipping;
in which he observes, that βαπτω, when used in these scriptures, Luke xvi. 24.
and John xiii. 26. is translated to <i>dip</i>; and in Rev. xix. 13. where we read of a
<i>vesture dipped in blood</i>; it is better rendered <i>stained</i>, by sprinkling blood upon
it; and all these scriptures denote only a touching one part of the body, and not
plunging. In other authors, it signifies, <i>tingo</i>, <i>immergo</i>, <i>lavo</i>, <i>abluo</i>; but in no
author it ever signifies to dip, but only in order to washing, or as the means of
washing. As for the Hebrew word טבל, rendered, by the LXX. in Gen.
xxxvii. 31. by μολύνω, <i>to stain by sprinkling</i>, or otherwise mostly by βαπτω: In 2
Kings v. 14. they render it by βαπτιζω, and no where else: In ver. 10. Elisha commands
Naaman to <i>wash</i>; and accordingly, ver. 14. pursuant to this order, it is
said, he <i>dipped himself seven times</i>; the word is ויטבל; which the LXX. render
εβαπτισατω; and in Exod. xii. 22. where the word טבל is used, which we render
<i>dip</i>, speaking concerning the dipping the bunch of hyssop in the blood, the
LXX. render it by the word βαπτω: And, in I Sam. xiv. 27; it is said, that Jonathan
dipped the end of his rod in an honey-comb; the word here is also ויטבל,
and the LXX. render it εβαψεν; in which place it cannot be understood of his
dipping it by plunging: And in Lev. iv. 6. 17. and chap. ix. 9. the priest is said
to dip his finger in the blood, which only intends his touching the blood, so as
to sprinkle it; and therefore does not signify plunging.</p>

<p class='c006'>This learned author likewise observes, that βαπτιζω signifies to wash; as instances
out of all authors may be given; and he particularly mentions Suidas,
Hesychius, Julius Pollux, and Phavorinus and Eustachius. And he further
adds, that it is first used in the scripture, in Mark i. 8. John i. 33. and to the
same purpose, Acts i. 5. in which place it signifies to pour; for the expression is
equivocal; <i>I baptize you with water, but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost</i>:
which is an accomplishment of that promise, that <i>the Holy Ghost should be poured
on them</i>. As for other places, in Mark vii. 2. 4. νίπτω, which signifies to <i>wash</i>,
and is so translated, is explained in the words immediately following, as signifying
<i>to baptize</i>. And, in Luke xi. 38. it is said, that the Pharisee marvelled that
our Saviour had not <i>washed before dinner</i>: The word in the Greek is ἐβαπτισθη,
to whom he replies in the following verse, <i>Ye Pharisees make clean the outside</i>,
&amp;c. so that the word, βαπτιζω signifies there to <i>cleanse</i>, or to use the means of
cleansing.</p>

<p class='c006'>He also observes, that though the original and natural signification of the
word imports, to <i>dip</i>, to <i>plunge</i>, to <i>dye</i>; yet it also signifies to <i>wash</i> or <i>cleanse</i>:
Nevertheless, he thinks that it is so far from signifying nothing else but to <i>dip</i>
or <i>plunge</i>, that when it is to be understood in that sense, the words ought to be
εμβάπτω, or εμβαπτιζω, rather than βαπτω, or βαπτίζω; and also that it no where
signifies to <i>dip</i>, but as denoting a mode of, and in order to washing; and that it
signifies to <i>wash</i>, in all good authors. He also refers to Scapula and Stephanus,
as translating the word βαπτιζω by <i>lavo</i>, or <i>abluo</i>; and Suidas, as rendering it by
<i>madefacio</i>, <i>lavo</i>, <i>abluo</i>, <i>purgo</i>, <i>mundo</i>: And he speaks of some authors, that he
had searched in every place wherein they mention baptism, and that he found
not one word to the purpose; and therefore concludes, that he was obliged to
say, and was ready to make it good, that no honest man, who understands the
Greek tongue, can deny the word to signify to <i>wash</i>, as well as to <i>dip</i>.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c012'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f89'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r89'>89</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dr. Wall, in the appendix of his reply to Dr. Gale, mentions a remarkable instance, in
which the mode of wetting or of applying water was certainly that of pouring, and not that
of dipping. It is as follows:—St. Origen, when commenting on the Baptism of John, enquires
thus of the Pharisees; “How could you think that Elias, when he should come, would <i>baptize</i>,
who did not in Ahab’s time <i>baptize</i> the wood upon the altar, which was to be washed before
it was burnt by the Lord’s appearing in fire? But he ordered the priest to do that; not once
only, but he says, do it the second time; and they did it the second time. And do it the
third time; and they did it the third time. Therefore, how could it be likely that this man,
who did not then <i>baptize</i>, but assigned that work to others, would himself <i>baptize</i>, when he
should, according to the prophecy of Malachi, again appear here on earth?”</p>

<p class='c006'>We find in the first book of Kings, xviii. 33, that the order given by Elijah was to fill four
barrels with water, and <i>pour</i> it on the wood and on the burnt offering. This <i>pouring of water</i>,
Origen, that accurate scholar, who lived in the second century, and was well acquainted with
the Greek classics, and Greek Testament, calls baptizing. In the very same sentence, he makes
use of the Greek word <i>Baptizo</i> four times; twice with express reference to the <i>Baptism</i> of
John; and twice with express reference to that <i>Baptism</i> which took place in the days of the
Prophet Elijah; which baptism, we are expressly told, was not performed by <i>dipping</i> the
wood and sacrifice into water, but by <i>pouring</i> water upon them.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is also evident, even from the frequent use of the word baptizo, by heathen authors, that it
does not always signify a total immersion. Mr. Walker tells us, “that Porphyrie mentions
a river in India, into which if an offender enters, or attempts to pass through it, he is immediately
<i>baptized</i> up to his head:” (<i>baptizetai mechri Kephales</i>.) Here a person is said to be
baptized, although his head did not go under, but remained above the water. This certainly
was not a total immersion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He also instances a case from Mr. Sydenham, as delivered by the oracle (viz. <i>askos baptize,
dunai de toi ou themis esti</i>.”) In which instance, if <i>dunai</i> signifies to plunge wholly under
water, as it certainly does, then <i>baptize</i> must signify something less than a total immersion.—“<i>Baptize
him as a bottle, but it is not lawful to plunge him wholly under the water.</i>” The
baptism here described, resembles that of a blown bladder or bottle of leather, which when put
into the water, will not sink to the bottom, but swim upon the top.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same critical author mentions an instance from Schrevelii’s and Robertson’s Lexicons,
19th chapter, in which case, the primitive word <i>bapto</i> signifies a wetting with water, that was
certainly less, and very different from a total dipping or immersion. The sentence is this.
(“<i>Baptei men askon, udor de ugron dunei pote.</i>”) “<i>He indeed baptizeth a bladder or bottle, but it
never goeth under the liquid water.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>To these instances, we might add a well known case, taken from a poem attributed to Homer,
called the battle of the frogs and the mice, in which the lake is said to be <i>baptized</i> by the blood
of a frog. (<i>Ebapteto de aimati limne porphureo.</i>) This lake was not <i>dipped</i> into the blood of
a frog; it was only <i>bespattered</i> and tinged therewith.</p>

<p class='c006'>We could easily multiply authorities if it were necessary. It appears undeniably evident
from the Greek classicks, and from learned writers and commentators, both ancient and modern,
that the word <i>baptizo</i> has other significations besides that of a total dipping or immersion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most celebrated and respectable Lexicographers and criticks have often translated
baptizo into the following Latin words, viz. <i>baptizo</i>, <i>mergo</i>, <i>immergo</i>, <i>tingo</i>, <i>intingo</i>, <i>lave</i>, <i>abluo</i>,
<i>madefacio</i>, <i>purgo</i>, <i>mundo</i>. No one, I presume, will pretend that all these words are mentioned
as being perfectly synonimous—of the same meaning exactly. And certainly if the word baptizo
signify any thing less or different from a total immersion, then persons may be baptized in
some other mode.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides, if it had been the intention of Christ and of his Apostles, to specify the mode, or to
have restricted all christians to one and the same mode of baptizing, they might, for this purpose,
have selected from the Greek language words of the most unequivocal and definite signification.
If it had been their intention to specify the mode of <i>sprinkling</i>, they might have used
the word <i>Rantizo</i>; if the mode of <i>pouring</i>, they might have used the word <i>Ekcheo</i>; if that
mode of <i>bathing</i> or <i>washing</i>, which is performed by the application of water with friction or
rubbing, they might have used the word <i>Louo</i>; and if it had been their intention to specify the
mode of <i>dipping</i>, they might have used the word <i>Dupto</i> or <i>Duno</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r96'>96</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In Col. ii. 12. and context, is a succession of figures, designed, in different
ways, to illustrate and enforce the same fact. Verse 11. “In whom also
ye are circumcised with the circumcision, <i>made without hands</i>, in putting off
the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.” That is, in
putting off the old man, you are circumcised without hands; the work is effected
by the Holy Spirit—You are born again, which is spiritual circumcision.
“Circumcision is that of the <i>heart</i>.” This renewing of the Holy Spirit consists
in putting off the body of sin, in renouncing sin, and reforming the life. Or,
we are “buried with him in baptism.” As the burial of Jesus Christ gave
evidence, that he had really died, the just for the unjust; that he had yielded
himself a sacrifice for sin; so we in our spiritual circumcision or baptism, the
figure now used, show ourselves to be really dead to sin, crucified in the lusts
of our minds. As Christ, when buried, was dead and separated from the world;
so in regeneration we become separate from sin. We are new creatures, having
put off the old man. We are buried from the wicked indulgences and pursuits of
the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>The death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, are, not only causes, but types
and symbols to represent the death of our sins, our putting off the old man, and
becoming new creatures.</p>

<p class='c006'>No reference is made in the text to the water of baptism, any more than to
the knife of circumcision in the preceding verse. The writer is speaking of
that baptism, and of that alone, in which we “are risen with Christ, through
the faith, which is the operation of God.” This certainly can be nothing less
than <i>spiritual</i> baptism, or regeneration; for the most violent advocate for
dipping, or plunging, or burying, will not pretend, that this, necessarily, is
connected with “faith;” he will allow it may be <i>possible</i> for a man to be plunged
and buried in <i>water</i>, and yet not have “the faith, which is the operation of God.”
If he allow this, and allow this he must and will, then our text is no support of
his cause. It cannot be water baptism which is mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>Were not this the fact, nothing could be inferred respecting the <i>mode</i> of
baptism. It would then only signify that, as Christ was buried and separated
from the world; so we in baptism are buried and separated from a world of sin.
The zeal for the literal construction of this figure may, perhaps, be extinguished
by indulging it in other instances. St. Paul says, “I am crucified with
Christ.” Would any person suppose from this, that he had been led to Calvary,
nailed to the cross, and pierced by the soldier’s spear? Christians are said to
be “circumcised in Christ.” Does any one infer from this that all Christians experience
the bloody rite of the Jews? Or, because Christians “are partakers
of Christ’s sufferings,” are all christians, therefore, betrayed by Judas, spit
upon, buffeted, and crowned with thorns? Or, because St. Paul says the Philippians
were his “<i>crown</i>,” were they, therefore, formed into a crown of honor,
and worn as a badge of future glory? Or, because the sacrament represents
the sufferings and death of Christ, are all worthy communicants crucified?
Were our baptist brethren consistent with themselves, such would be their
explanation of these passages of scripture.</p>

<p class='c006'>It immediately follows our text; “wherein also you were risen with him
through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.”
Wherein, or in which baptism “we are risen,” actually “risen with Christ by
the faith” which God gives to the new creature. You, who have this spiritual
baptism, rise like Christ above the selfish motives, and sensual pursuits of a
fallen world. You seek the kingdom of God; you aspire after divine good.</p>

<p class='c006'>Persons, born again, like Jesus Christ, separate their hearts from the world,
and rise to a divine life. That this is the only true construction of the text,
may be inferred from a corresponding passage, Rom. vi. 4. “Therefore we are
buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised from the
dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”
By spiritual baptism we partake the privileges of Christ’s death. By dying to
sin ourselves, as we do in the new birth, we resemble Jesus Christ in his death,
who died “to make an end of sin.” As Christ was raised from the grave; so
we, not in water baptism, but in regeneration or spiritual baptism, are “raised”
to walk in newness of life. Old things are done away; <i>all</i> things are become
new. If we have experienced this spiritual baptism, we shall have the Spirit of
Christ, We shall be separate from the world of sin, as Christ was in the grave,
and we shall like him rise to a holy, a new life. We obey a new master, seek a
new way of salvation, act from new motives, to accomplish new designs; we
choose new companions, experience new sorrows, and new joys. As if buried,
we are separate from our former lives.</p>

<p class='c006'>St. John says, “He [Christ] shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
<i>fire</i>.” The Selucians and Hermians understood this literally, and maintained
that material fire was necessary in the administration of baptism. Valentinus,
like our baptists, rebaptized those, who had received baptism out of the sect,
and <i>drew them through the fire</i>. Herculian, cited by Clemens Alexandrinus, says
that some applied a red hot iron to the ears of the baptized. St. Paul says, we
are buried with Christ in baptism. This also has been understood literally;
but such persons forget that to be consistent, on their plan, they should continue
“buried” three days and three nights, the time Christ lay in the earth. Should
any object that this would drown them, the baptist, in his way of treating
figures, would have an easy answer, and readily prove that drowning was the
very design of baptism. Rom. vi. 4. “We are buried with him by baptism
into his death.” We are not merely buried, for this is only a part, any more
than sprinkling; but we are buried to death, “buried into his death.” Thus he
has scripture for drowning all whom he baptizes, and precisely as much scripture
for drowning, as for burying. The very same passage, might he say,
which commands burying, commands drowning, commands “death.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In the present mode of plunging, the resemblance is almost entirely lost.
What is the difference between laying a dead body in a rock, covering it with
a great stone; sealing it in a solemn manner; all things continuing in this state,
three days and three nights, what is the resemblance between this, and suddenly
plunging a living body into water, and instantly lifting it out of the water?
What possible likeness is there between a <i>living person</i> in the <i>water</i>, and a <i>dead
body</i> in a <i>rock</i>? The similitude is little better than that of the blind man, who
supposed the light of the sun was like the noise of a cannon. We have accordingly
endeavoured to show in the introduction, that the elegant scholar,
the christian orator of Tarsus, had no thought of any such resemblance; his
object was to show, that in regeneration or spiritual baptism, which is followed
“with newness of life,” or, a new life, “through faith which is the operation of
God,” we are dead and buried to sin, and raised or made alive to God, as Christ
was. The evident design of the text is to illustrate the preceding verse, which
speaks of spiritual circumcision made without hands. This <i>baptism</i> is that by
which we are <i>raised with Christ</i>; but in water baptism we are not always raised
with Christ. If men are plunged they may generally be raised from the water;
but this has no necessary connexion with “rising with Christ.” This baptism
is also effected “through faith which is the operation of God;” but a man may
be raised out of an ocean of water, every day of his life, and remain destitute of
faith; therefore, the text has no reference to water baptism.</p>

referred to in the New Testament, as having their accomplishment in Christ, are
to be understood as containing a double reference, namely, to David, as denoting his
particular case, and to Christ, of whom he was an eminent type. But as for Psalm
xxii. there are several expressions in it, not only applied to Christ in the New Testament;
but they cannot well be understood of any other but him. In the first verse
he uses the same words that were uttered by Christ on the cross, Matt. xxvii. 46.
My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? and in ver. 8. he trusted in the
Lord that he would deliver him; let him deliver him: This was an expression
used by those who mocked and derided him, Matt. xxvii. 41, 45. And what is said
in verses 14, 17. All my bones are out of joint; I may tell them, they look and
stare upon me; does not seem to be applicable to David, from any thing said concerning
him elsewhere; but they are a lively representation of the torment a person
endures, when hanging on a cross, as our Saviour did; which has a tendency to disjoint
the bones, and cause them to stick out. And when it is said, ver. 16, 18.
they pierced my hands and my feet; and they part my garments among them, and
cast lots upon my vesture; the former was fulfilled in Christ’s being nailed to the
cross, and his side pierced with a spear; and the latter is expressly referred to as
fulfilled in the parting of Christ’s garments, and casting lots upon his vesture,
Matt. xxvii. 35. as an accomplishment of what was foretold, by the royal prophet in
this Psalm. These expressions cannot, in the least, be applied to David, but are to
be understood of our Saviour; therefore, we may conclude that those words in ver.
6. I am a worm, &amp;c. are particularly applied to him.</i></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f119'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r119'>119</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It has been said, that there cannot be any reason or motive to pray, or
make any petition, to an <i>unchangeable God</i>, whose design cannot be altered, and
who has fixed all events, without a possibility of any change.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before any attempt is made to remove this objection, and supposed difficulty,
it must be observed, that it equally lies against the <i>foreknowledge of God</i>. For
if God certainly foreknows every thing that will take place, then every event
is fixed and certain, otherwise it could not be foreknown. “Known unto God
are all his works from the beginning of the world.” He has determined, and
passed an unchangeable decree, with respect to all that he will do to eternity.
Upon the plan of the objection under consideration, it may be asked, What
reason or motive can any one have to ask God to do any thing for him, or any
one else, since he infallibly knows from the beginning what he will do, and
therefore it is unalterably fixed? Therefore if it be reasonable to pray to an
<i>omniscient</i> God, it is equally reasonable to pray to an <i>unchangeable</i> God. For the
former necessarily implies the latter. But in order to show that the objection
is without foundation, the following things must be observed.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. If God were not omniscient and unchangeable, and had not foreordained
whatsoever comes to pass, he would not be the proper object of worship, and
there would be no foundation, reason, or encouragement to make any petition to
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>This, it is presumed, will be evident to any one who will well consider the
following observations.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>First.</i> If there were no unchangeable, omniscient Being, there would be no
God, no proper object of worship. A being who is capable of change, is necessarily
imperfect, and may change from bad to worse, and even cease to exist,
and therefore could not be trusted. If we could know that such a being has
existed, and that he was once wise, and good, and powerful, we could have no
evidence that he would continue to be wise or good, or that he is so now, or
that he is now disposed to pay any regard to our petitions, or is either willing
or able to grant them; or even that he has any existence. What reason of encouragement
then can there be to pray to a changeable being? Surely none at
all. Therefore, if there be no reason to pray to an <i>unchangeable God</i>, there can
be no reason to pray at all.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Secondly.</i> If God be infinitely wise, and good, and omnipotent, supreme and
independent; then he certainly is unchangeable, and has foreordained whatsoever
comes to pass. This has been proved above, or rather is self-evident. But if
he be not infinitely wise and good, &amp;c. then he cannot be trusted; he cannot be
the object of that trust and confidence which is implied, and even expressed, in
praying to him.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Thirdly.</i> The truly pious, benevolent, devout man would not desire, or
even <i>dare</i>, to pray to God for any thing, if he were changeable, and disposed
to alter his purpose and plan, in order to grant his petitions. Therefore he
never does pray to any but an <i>unchangeable God</i>, whose counsel stands forever,
and the thoughts of his heart to all generations. He is sensible that he is a very
imperfect creature; that his heart, his will, is awfully depraved and sinful; that
he knows not what is wisest and best to be done in any one instance; what is
best for him, for mankind in general, for the world, or for the universe; what
is most for the glory of God, and the greatest general good; and that it would
be infinitely undesirable and dreadful to have his own will regarded so as to
govern in determining what shall be done for him or any other being, or what
shall take place. If it could be left to him to determine in the least instance,
he would not dare to do it, but would refer it back to God, and say, “Not <i>my
will</i>, but <i>thine</i> be done.” But he could not do this, unless he were <i>certain</i> that
the will of God was unchangeably wise and good, and that he had decreed to do
what was most for his own glory, and the greatest good of the whole; at the
same time infallibly knowing what must take place, in every instance, in order
to answer this end; and consequently must have fixed upon the most wise and
best plan, foreordaining whatsoever comes to pass. Therefore, whatever be his
petitions for himself, or for others, he offers them to God, and asks, <i>on this condition</i>,
always either expressed or implied, <i>If it be agreeable to thy will</i>: for
<i>otherwise</i> he would not have his petitions granted, if it were possible. And he
who asks any thing of God, without making this condition, but sets up his own
will, and desires to have it gratified, whether it be for the glory of God, and the
greatest good of his kingdom, or not; and would, were it in his power, compel
his Maker to grant his petition, and bow the will of God to his own will; he
who prays to God with such a disposition, is an impious enemy to God, exercises
no true devotion, and cannot be heard; and it is desireable to all the friends of
God that he should be rejected. Resignation to the will of God always supposes
his will is unchangeably fixed and established, which it could not be,
unless he has foreordained whatsoever comes to pass.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus it appears that if God were changeable, and had not foreordained whatsoever
comes to pass, there would be no foundation for religious worship, or
reason for praying to him; or that there can be no reason or encouragement for
prayer and petition to any but an <i>unchangeable</i> God.—I proceed to observe,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. There is good reason, and all desirable and possible encouragement, to
pray to an unchangeable God, who has from eternity determined what he will
do, in every instance, and has foreordained whatsoever comes to pass.</p>

<p class='c006'>This will doubtless be evident, to him who will duly, consider the following
particulars.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>First.</i> Prayer is as proper, important, and necessary, in order to obtain favour
from an unchangeable God, as it could be were he changeable, and had not foreordained
any thing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Means are as necessary in order to obtain the end, as if nothing were fixed and
certain. Though it was decreed that Paul and all the men in the ship should
get safe to land, when they were in a storm at sea; yet this must be accomplished
by means, and unless the sailors had assisted in managing the ship, this
event could not take place, and they could not be saved. Prayer is a means of
obtaining what God had determined to grant; for he has determined to give it
in answer to prayer, and no other way. “Ask, and ye shall receive,” says our
Saviour. When God had promised to do many and great things for Israel, he
adds, “Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be inquired of by the house
of Israel, to do it for them:” [<i>Ezek.</i> xxxvi. 37.] The granting the favours,
which God had determined to bestow, was as much suspended on their asking
for them, as if there had been nothing determined and fixed about it. There is
as much regard had to prayer in granting favours, and the prayer is heard, and
God gives them, as really and as much in answer to it, as if there were nothing
determined and foreordained respecting them: for the decree includes and fixes
the means, as much as the end; the method and way by which events are to
take place, as much as those events themselves. The one depends on the other,
as much as if there were no decree, and nothing fixed; yea, much more: for the
decree <i>fixes</i> the dependence and connexion between the means and the end:
whereas if there were no decree, and nothing fixed, there would be no established
connexion, but all would be uncertain, and there would be no reason or
encouragement to use means, or do any thing to obtain an end.</p>

<p class='c006'>Surely, then, there is as much reason and encouragement to pray to an unchangeable
God, and this is as important and necessary, as if there were nothing
fixed by the divine decrees, and much more: yea, the unchangeable purposes
of God are the necessary and only proper ground and reason of prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Secondly.</i> Though prayer is not designed to make any change in God, or alter
his purpose, which is impossible; yet it is suited and designed to have an effect
on the petitioner, and prepare him to receive that for which he prays. And this
is a good reason why he should pray. It tends to make the petitioner to feel
more and more sensibly his wants, and those of others for whom he prays, and
the miserable state in which he and they are: for in prayer these are called up
to view, and dwelt upon: and prayer tends to give a sense of the worth and
importance of the favours asked. It is also suited to make persons feel, more
and more, their own helplessness, and entire dependence on God for the favours
for which they petition, of which their praying is an acknowledgment: and therefore
tends to enhance them in the eyes of the petitioner, when given in answer to
prayer, and make him more sensible of the free, sovereign goodness of God in
granting them.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c012'><sup>[120]</sup></a> In sum, this is suited to keep the existence and character of
God in view, and impress a sense of religious truths in general on the mind,
and to form the mind to universal obedience, and a conscientious watchfulness
and circumspection, in all religious exercises.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Thirdly.</i> It is reasonable, and highly proper and important, and for the honour
of God, that the friends of God should express and acknowledge their entire dependence
on him, and trust in him, for all they want for themselves and others,
and their belief in the power, wisdom and goodness of God; and all this is acknowledged,
expressly or implicity, in prayer to God. It is also reasonable and
proper that they should express their <i>desire</i> of those things which are needed by
themselves or others, and which God alone can give or accomplish: and such
desires are expressed in the best way and manner by petitioning for them. And
in asking for blessings on others, and praying for their enemies, they express
their benevolence, which is an advantage to themselves, and pleasing to God,
even though their petitions should have no influence in procuring the favours
which they ask. And in praying that God would honour himself, and advance
his own kingdom, and accomplish all the great and glorious things which he has
promised to do for his own honour, and the good of his people, they do not express
any doubts of his fulfilling his promises, but are certain he will grant their
petitions; but they hereby express their acquiescence in these things, and their
earnest desire that they may be accomplished; and also profess and express their
love to God, and friendship to his people and kingdom; and do that which the
feelings of a pious, benevolent heart will naturally, and even necessarily, prompt
them to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have many examples of such petitions and prayers for those things and
events, which the petitioners, antecedent to their prayers, knew would certainly
be accomplished. We have a decisive and remarkable instance of this in David,
the king of Israel, in the following words: “And now, O Lord God, the word
that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish
it for ever, <i>and do as thou hast said</i>. And let thy name be magnified forever,
saying, The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy
servant David be established before thee. For thou, O Lord of hosts, God of
Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, <i>I will build thee an house: therefore
hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer before thee</i>. And now, O
Lord God, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised
this goodness unto thy servant. Therefore now let it please thee to bless the
house of thy servant, that it may continue forever before thee; for thou, O Lord
God, hast spoken it, and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed
forever:” [<i>2 Sam.</i> vii. 25-29.] Here David not only prays God to do that which
at the same time he knew and acknowledges God had promised to do; and
therefore it was established as firm as the throne of the Almighty, and decreed
that it should take place; but he says that this promise of God, making it certain,
was the reason, motive, and encouragement to him to make this prayer:
“Thou, O Lord, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house.
And now, O Lord God, thou art that God, <i>and thy words be true, and thou hast
promised this goodness unto thy servant</i>; <span class='fss'>THEREFORE HATH THY SERVANT FOUND IN
HIS HEART TO PRAY THIS PRAYER BEFORE THEE</span>.” We hence are warranted to
assert that it is reasonable and proper to pray for that which God has promised;
and that the certainty that it will be accomplished is a motive and encouragement
to pray for it. How greatly then do they err, who think that if every
event is made certain by God’s decree, there is no reason or encouragement to
pray for any thing!</p>

<p class='c006'>Our Saviour, in the pattern of prayer which he has dictated, directs men to
pray that God would bring to pass those events which are already fixed and
decreed, and therefore must infallibly take place; “Our Father, who art in
heaven, <i>hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come, thy will be done</i>,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>Christ himself, in the 17th chapter of John, prays for those whom the Father
had given to him, that he would keep them through his own name, and that
they might be <i>one</i>, as the Father and Son were one; might be kept from the
evil in the world, and be sanctified through the truth; that they might be with
him in heaven forever, and behold his glory. At the same time he knew that
all this was made certain to them; for he had before said, that all that were
given to him should come to him, and he would raise them up at the last day;
that he would give unto them eternal life, and not one of them should perish, as
none should be able to pluck them out of his hands, or his Father’s. He prays,
“Father, glorify thy name;” not because this event was uncertain, but to express
his earnest desire of that which he knew was decreed, and could not but
take place, and his willingness to give up every thing, even his own life to promote
this. Again, Christ prays in the following words: “And now, O Father,
glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before
the world was.” The event for which Christ prays in these words was decreed
from eternity, and the decree had been long before published, in the 2d
and 110th Psalms: “I will declare the decree: The Lord hath said unto me,
Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give
thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
thy possession. Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy foot-stool.”
And he had declared the certainty of that for which he here prays,
since his incarnation. He had said, that all power in heaven and earth was
given unto him; that “the Father had committed all judgment unto the Son;
that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.” St. Paul,
when speaking of God, often introduces the following words: “To whom be glory
forever, Amen;” which is not to be considered as a mere doxology, by which
glory is <i>ascribed</i> to God; but it is rather a <i>wish</i>, or <i>desire</i>, that God may be
glorified forever; and the <i>Amen</i> corroborates it: as if he had said, “Let it be
so; this is the most ardent desire of my soul, including the sum of all my petitions.”
Here then the Apostle utters a desire and petition for that which he
knew was decreed, and would take place.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last words of Christ to his church are, “Surely I come quickly.” Upon
which promise the following petition of the church, and of every friend of his,
is presented to him: “Amen, even so come Lord Jesus.” Here is a petition, in
which all Christians join, praying Christ to do what he has promised; and which
therefore was as certain as a declared decree could possibly make it; and the
petition is grounded on this promise and decree published by Christ, in which
the petitioners express their hearty approbation of the coming of Christ, and
earnest desire of this important and happy event. And if it be reasonable thus
to pray for an event which is fixed and made certain by an unchangeable decree,
and cannot be altered, as in the instance before us; then it is reasonable and
proper to pray for any thing or any event which appears to us desirable and important,
though we know God is unchangeable, and that all things and every
event are fixed by an unalterable decree.</p>

<p class='c006'>The apostle John says, “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that
if we ask any thing <i>according to his will</i>, he heareth us. And if we know that he
heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we
desired of him:” [<i>1 John</i> v. 14, 15.] To ask for any thing <i>according to his will</i>,
is to ask for those things which it is agreeable to his will to grant; and this is
to be known only by what he has revealed. When we ask him to do what he
has declared he will do, then we know we ask for that which is according to his
will; and consequently that we have our petitions. But it will be asked, What
are these things? I answer, that God will glorify himself in all things, and
make the brightest display of his perfections and character forever; that he will
promote and effect the greatest possible good of the universe; that he will make
his church and kingdom perfectly happy and glorious forever; that he will accomplish
all his designs and predictions, and fulfil all his promises to his church
and people: and cause all things to work for the good of those who love him;
and give his holy Spirit to all who ask him. These, I think, must be the things
we ask, when we know that we pray for any thing <i>according to the will of God</i>,
and consequently know that he heareth us, and that we have the petitions that
we desired of him. But in all these instances we ask for that which God has
said he will do, that is, has decreed that he will do them. And as it has been
said before, if a decree in these instances does not render it unreasonable or improper
to pray for their accomplishment; then, if God has decreed <i>whatsoever
comes to pass</i>, this is not in the least inconsistent with our praying for whatever
appears to us desirable and good, and may not be contrary to the will of God to
grant. But here it must be observed, that when we ask for any particular things
or events which, though it may not be contrary to the will of God to grant, yet
he has in no way revealed that it is his will to grant our petitions; when we ask
for any such thing, we must do it with an express or implicit reserve—<i>If it be
according to the will of God</i>. Otherwise, or if it be not according to his will, we
must withdraw our petition, and not desire to have it granted. Resignation to
the will of God, whatever it may be, in all such instances, is essential to the
pious petitions of a benevolent friend of God. And by thus referring to the will
of God, and resigning to that, desiring it may be done in all cases, whatever petitions
we may make, we do refer to the decrees of God, by which he has determined
what he will do in every particular instance; for his will and his decrees
are in this case one and the same, being fixed and unchangeable.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fourthly.</i> It is not only proper and important that the worshippers of God
should express their desires of those things which they want, in praying for them;
but were this not true, and were not asking for them the means and way of obtaining
them; yet the pious friends of God would esteem it a privilege and enjoyment
to be allowed and invited, “by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving,
to make known their requests unto him.” To them prayer is not a <i>task</i>, from
which they would be glad to be excused, but they practise it with pleasure.—They
have great support, enjoyment and happiness, in casting their cares upon
God, and expressing the desires of their hearts to him. While others restrain
prayer before God, and say, “What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
and what profit should we have if we pray unto him?” the benevolent friend of
God would pray, were it only for the enjoyment which he has in the exercise;
and says in his heart, “I will call upon God as long as I live. And though he is
certain that God is unchangeable, and that nothing is done, or will come to pass,
which is not foreordained by him, this does not tend to prevent or in the least
abate the pleasure and enjoyment he has in making known his requests to God,
or his desire constantly to practise it: but this truth gives him support and
consolation, and increases his delight in calling upon God, and renders it more
desirable and pleasant unto him: yea, were not this a truth, he could not find
any reason for making his requests known to him, or any delight in doing it;
and would not have any encouragement, or even <i>dare</i>, to ask for any thing, as
has been observed and shewn.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And now this matter is to be left to the judgment of every one who will attend
to it. It is hoped that it appears evident, beyond all dispute, from the light
in which this subject has been now set, that the doctrine of God’s decreeing
whatsoever comes to pass is not only consistent with all the exercises of true
piety, but is the proper foundation for this, and is suited to excite and promote
these exercises, and that there can be no real piety which is not consistent with
this truth.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r120'>120</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A kind and wise father, who designs to give his child some particular favour, will bring
the child to ask for it before he bestows it, and will suspend the gift upon this condition, for
the benefit of the child, that what he grants may be a real advantage to him, and a greater than
if it were given before the child was better prepared to receive it, by earnestly and humbly
asking for it; and that the father may hereby receive a proper acknowledgment from the
child, and be treated in a becoming manner. And in this case, the petition of the child is as
really regarded, heard and granted, and the child’s application and prayer to the father is as
much a means of obtaining the favour, and as proper, important, and necessary, as if the father
had not previously determined the whole affair. And when the children of such a father know
that this is his way of bestowing favours on them, they will have as proper motives, and as
much encouragement, to ask for all they want, as if he had not determined what he would
do antecedent to their asking him; yea, much more.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r123'>123</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In our day and country there are some worthy men, who without fear,
or scruple, affirm, that God is the <i>author</i>, and <i>cause</i> of sin; which words they
soften to avoid the blasphemy, which they contain. We have in a note, I. vol. p. 530,
given the sentiments of the late Dr. Williams, on the origination of sin. Being
a proficient in the study of the human mind, he has philosophized a little on, but
not essentially differed from the representation of the subject, as it is found in
the writings of sound protestant divines. As some American writers advocate
with considerable address, such divine causality, and publicly affirm it to
have been taught by Luther, Calvin, &amp;c. and to have found its place in our
standards in the words—“foreordained whatsoever comes to pass;” it is proper
to resort to the ipsissima verba of some of the European protestant theologians,
as a test of such allegations.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Westminster divines, no doubt, entertained the same views of sin, which
will be found in the following extracts. In their definition of sin, they not obscurely
shew, that they did consider it not more a <i>transgression of</i>, than <i>a want
of conformity unto, the law</i>. The former is the translation of ανομια in I. John iii.
4. which is rather <i>privatio</i>, <i>defectus</i>, or <i>declinatio</i> than <i>transgressio legis</i>. Also
the Greek word αμαρτια, and the Hebrew חטא signify <i>non consecutio scopi</i>. If
they viewed sin as a <i>qualitas adventitia</i>, a <i>quiddam non positivum</i>, a <i>simplex privatio</i>,
a <i>quiddam actioni inhærens</i>, they could not have viewed it the proper subject
of a decree or purpose, but only as foreseen and permitted.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following quotations are given in the authors’ own words, for the satisfaction
of those who may not possess the works from which they are taken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Natura peccato corrupta est...—Aversio quædam voluntatis secuta est, ut
homo nihil eorum velit aut faciat, quæ Deus vult et præcipit. Item quod
nescimus, quid Deus, quid gratia, quid justitia, denique quid ipsum peccatum sit.
Hi sunt profecto horribiles <span class='fss'>DEFECTUS</span>, quos, qui non intelligunt; nec vident, talpa
cœciores sunt.” Mart. Lutheri Loc. Com. p. 23.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hæc Regula certa et vera est; Deum esse natura bonum, ideo nihil a Deo
proficisci, nisi quod bonum est, mors autem est mala, peccatum etiam est malum,
&amp;c. Non igitur a Deo proficiscuntur mala hæc, &amp;c. Peccati porro quæ
causa sit, si roges, sacræ literæ ostendunt, id ex Sathana esse, cui contra verbum
Dei assenserunt nostri parentes, a Deo inobedientes facti, incurrerunt in horribiles
pænas. Nam per peccatum illud non solum corpora nostra sic infirmata
sunt, ut ex immortalibus mortalia fierent, sed etiam mens depravata est.
Amisit enim homo veram Dei notitiam, et voluntas quoque tum admodum est
depravata, ut nihil quam malum appetat.” Mart. Lutheri Loci Com. p. 22.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eant nunc qui Deum suis vitiis inscribere audent, quia dicimus naturaliter
vitiosos esse homines. Opus Dei perperam in sua pollutione scrutantur, quod in
integra adhuc et incorrupta Adæ natura requirere debuerant. A carnis ergo
nostræ culpa, non a Deo nostra perditio est, quando non alia ratione periimus,
nisi quia degeneravimus a prima nostra conditione.”—“Dicimus ergo naturali
hominem vitiositate corruptum, sed quæ a natura non fluxerit. A natura
fluxisse negamus, ut significemus adventitiam magis esse qualitatem quæ
homini acciderit, quam substantialem proprietatem quæ ab initio indita fuerit.
Vocamus tamen naturalem, nequis ab unoquoque prava consuetudine comparari
putet, quum hæreditario jure universos comprehensos teneat.” <i>Calvini Institut.</i>
<i>lib.</i> II. <i>cap.</i> 1. <i>sect.</i> 10, 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sed cum nihil contingat in mundo, aut contingere possit sine justissima
et sapientissima Dei providentia, annon, peccati author et causa dici potest?

<p class='c006'>“Deus non infundit malitiam in volentates malorum, sicut infundit bonitatem
in corda piorum, nec impellit aut allicit voluntates ad peccandum; sed tantum
malas voluntates, seu peccantes, quales invenit ex corruptione quæ sequuta est
aversionem diabolorum et hominum a Deo, movet, ciet, flectit, inclinat, dirigit,
sapienter, juste, potenter, ubi, quando, quomodo, et quousque vult, sive mediate,
sive immediate, ad objecta vel persequenda, vel fugienda, ut impleant (quibus
tale nihil propositum est) quod manus et consilium Domini decrevit. <i>Bucani
Theol. p. 153.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>“Estne peccatum originis Substantia an accidens?—Non est substantia;
esset enim anima vel corpus. Jam vero corpus et anima quoad substantiam,
sunt bonæ Dei creaturæ, quæ etiamnum creantur a Deo. Ergo non sunt peccatum.
Nec substantialis est proprietas, aut aliquid substantiale in homine:
sed est adventitia qualitas, quæ tamen naturalis dicitur, non quod à natura fluxerit
(quatenus creata est) sed quia hæreditario jure ut dicitur, suos comprehensos
tenet, et in ipsa hominis natura, viribus, et facultatibus naturalibus inhæret,
et ipsi homini innata est.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Bucani Theol.</i> p. 174.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Estne peccatum aliquid Positivum an Privativum?—Peccatum non est positivum,
id est, quiddam subsistens a Deo conditum, nec est simpliciter et pura
privatio, sicut mors est privatio vitæ, aut tenebræ sunt privatio lucis; sed est
defectus seu destructio rei positivæ, videlicit operis et ordinis divini in subjecto,
quod culpam sustinet suæ depravationis, aversionis a Deo, ut ruina in domo,
cœcitas et amissio visus in oculis.” <i>Bucani Theol.</i> p. 167.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Permissio est gubernatio Dei, quâ homines vel diabolos, ad peccandum
pronos, a peccato non retrahit, sed gratiæ suæ auxilio negato vel subtracto, in

<p class='c006'>Si viator aliquis a latrone in via occidatur, homicidium permississe Deus
dicitur:</p>

<p class='c006'>(1.) Quia efficax gratiæ suæ auxilium ei subtraxit vel negavit, sine quo infallibiliter
homicidium erat perpetraturus.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2.) Quia animum latronis, naturâ vel consuetudine ad homicidia pronum, ab

<p class='c006'>(3.) Quia concilium homicidii perpetrandi, ipsumque latronis impetum ita

viatorem, quam alium hominem objecit: justo quodam judicio: cujus ratio plerumque

<p class='c006'>(4.) Quia, quod malo fine a latrone est perpetratum; forte ad pecuniam

<p class='c006'>II. Sunt igitur in peccatis hominum, circa quæ divina occupatur permissio,

<p class='c006'>(2.) Vitium actioni inhærens.</p>

<p class='c006'>(3.) Directio organi mali et actionis vitiosæ in objectum certum.</p>

<p class='c006'>(4.) Finis directionis, e quo accidit peccato judicii divini ratio; ut per hominum
peccata Deus exequatur justa sua judicia: Primum, tertium, et quartum
a Deo est, Deumque authorem habet. Est enim omnis actio, quatenus est
actio, bona: directio actionis et ipsa bona: denique finis directionis optimus,
nempe divini judicii executio. Secundum, in quo peccati consistit ratio, non
a Deo, sed a solo est homine: adeoque solus homo peccati, quatenus est peccatum
author est. <i>Wendel. Theol. p. 179.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>“Hinc firmiter concludimus, cum permissione Dei concurrere quoque efficacem

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
